 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_TSAR_VLADIMIR_DESC:0 "1917년 망명 중 태어난 블라디미르 키릴로비치 로마노프 대공은 1938년 고인이 된 차르 니콜라 2세의 사촌인 아버지 키릴 블라디미로비치의 죽음으로 러시아 황실의 우두머리가 되었습니다.\n\n2차 세계대전 당시엔 브르타뉴에 거주하였고, 그는 곧 자신과 그의 가족이 독일에 유치되어 있다는 것을 알았습니다. 독일 당국의 '침묵'에 그는 곧 협력에 나서면서 러시아의 탈소련 체제를 부추기는 라디오 방송을 만들었습니다. 전쟁 말기엔 우크라이나 섭정을 제의받았고, 그는 그것이 용납할 수 없을 정도로 러시아를 분열시킨다는 이유로 거절했습니다.\n\n그러나 전쟁이 끝났음에도 불구하고, 독일인들은 블라소프와 마찬가지로 그의 인기가 그들의 통치를 약화시킬 수 있다고 우려해서 블라디미르는 러시아로 다시 돌아갈 수 없었습니다. 서러시아 전쟁이 되어서야 그는 자신이 군주주의자들과 추방된 백군들로 구성된 사단을 규합하는 것을 허용하도록 그들을 설득할 수 있었습니다. 그러나 독일 국방군의 공세가 중단되자, 블라디미르는 러시아에서 통치권을 구축하기 위해 돌파하지 못했습니다.\n\n그 후 몇년 동안 새로 선포된 차르 블라디미르 3세는 그의 통치권을 확장하는데 거의 성공하지 못했고, 그외에도 많은 국내 문재들이 발견되고 있습니다. 이제 러시아의 차르는 확장할 수 있는 순간까지 시간을 벌며 기다리고 있습니다. 그의 신성한 권리로 모든 러시아를 되찾을 수 있는 그 순간까지 말입니다."

 POLITICS_BORIS_SKOSSYREFF_DESC:0 "The story of West Russia's last monarch, Boris I, is a bizarre, yet fascinating one. Boris Mikhailovich Skosyrev was born to a rich family in Vilna, then part of the Russian Empire. While he was a member of a family that belonged to the gentry, he was never a claimant to any throne by birth - but what he couldn't get through his bloodline, he would earn on his own.\n\nWhen the October Revolution broke out, Boris fled and became one of the many emigrés. He would soon distinguish himself in the British Foreign Office, partaking in many missions before arriving in the Netherlands and then finding where his most famous adventure so far would unfold: the country of Andorra. After carefully plotting, he took the title of Prince with popular support in the 1930s, and promised to bring Andorra into the modern age. He would soon be arrested and imprisoned, but luckily, after spending a few years in prisons around Western Europe, he would be released by the Nazi occupation authorities and begin to collaborate with them. With the advent of the West Russian War and Tsar Vladimir's expedition, he gladly joined him, and stood by him as a loyal liaison - until it became inconvenient to do so.\n\nSkossyrev would not stay idle as the Anti-Communist Guard achieved victory after victory. One day, as the troops came closer to Vyatka, he would come to the city center, guns blazing, and declare the former West Russian authority to have ended, replaced by Kirpichnikov's army. In the place of the city's corrupt rulers, Boris I now rules as Prince of Vyatka and guardian of the frontier, in the name of the Anti-Communist Guard and the Russian people. For how long this principality will last, who knows."

 ### Ideas ###
 KIR_unrepentant_reaction:0 "부끄럼 없는 반응"
 KIR_unrepentant_reaction_desc:0 "옛 러시아 제국이 멸망한 이후 우리는 계속해서 폭군 밑에 깔려 고통받고 있습니다. 공산주의자와 숨겨진 대리인 사회주의는 러시아 국민들이 남긴 작은 것을 빼앗기 위해 지칠 줄 모르고 노력해 왔으며, 이에 대하여 차르는 '더 이상은 안된다!'라고 선언하셨습니다. 제국은 다시 부활하고 공산주의자들은 멸망할 것이며 차르의 정당한 통치로 평화는 다시 위대한 땅, 러시아로 돌아올 것입니다."

 KIR_officer_infighting:0 "군대에서의 내분"
 KIR_officer_infighting_desc:0 "백군, 또는 그 잔재들은 한번도 통일 전선을 이룬적이 없습니다. 공산주의에 대한 공통된 증오로 그들은 하나로 뭉치겠지만, 통일된 러시아가 어떻게 통치되어야 하는가에 대한 질문은 차르의 충성스러운 군대의 단결을 깨뜨릴 위험이 있습니다. 일부는 오래된 이상을 믿고, 일부는 민주주의를 원하며, 일부는 파시즘 정권의 강점에 대해 이야기합니다. 차르만이 그들을 묶어두는 유일한 존재입니다. 국가가 잃어버린 것을 재건하려면 군대가 단결해야 한다는 것은 분명합니다."

 KIR_officers_reigned_in:0 "합류한 장교들"
 KIR_officers_reigned_in_desc:0 "비록 어려웠지만, 국가는 군 장교단의 최악의 영향과 행동들을 모두 억제하는 데 성공했습니다. 비록 문제가 있는 장교들을 면직시키거나 기소되어 시간이 걸리고 정치적 영향력과 인력 차질을 야기할 것이지만, 차르께서는 그의 장교들이 곧 의도적으로 단결될 것이라고 확신할 수 있습니다. 분열된 지도부는 더 이상 아군에 부정적인 영향을 미치지 않을 것입니다."

 KIR_the_tsar_and_himself:0 "차르께서 직접 나서다"
 KIR_the_tsar_and_himself_desc:0 "옛날처럼 차르께서는 절대 권력으로 다스립니다. 그러나 최근 들어 자유주의와 민주적 이상이 신하들의 마음과 마음 속에서 떠오르는 것을 목격하고 있습니다. 비록 많은 사람들이 그에게 이러한 발전들을 완전히 무시하라고 조언하고 있지만, 차르께서는 자기가 벼랑 끝에 서 있다는 것을 잘 알고 있습니다. 차르는 그의 백성들의 사랑이 예전처럼 매우 빠르게 증오로 변할 수 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다. 그러므로 그는 곧 다음과 같은 선택을 해야 합니다. 그의 조상들이 그랬던 것처럼 혼자서 통치하거나, 아니면 그의 정부에서 백성들에게 그들의 발언권을 주는 것입니다."

 KIR_the_peoples_tsar_idea:0 "사람들의 황제"
 KIR_the_peoples_tsar_idea_desc:0 "차르께서는 자신의 여러 단체들과 연대하는 모습을 보여주려는 그의 노력에 발맞춰, 노동자들을 만나고 그들에게 가장 큰 영향을 미치는 문제들을 해결하기 위해 행동하며, 많은 공장과 산업 시설들을 정신없이 빠르게 진행되는 순방 계획에 착수하셨습니다. 비록 그렇게 함으로써 얻는 정치적 이익에 아무도 흠을 잡을 수 없고, 차르의 개인적인 관심이 의심 할 여지없이 높은 생산 수준을 보여주기 위해 최선을 다하는 공장으로 이어질 것이지만, 선언된 '솔루션'이 갑자기 시행되면서 효율성이 떨어질 가능성이 높습니다."

 KIR_imperial_detachment_idea:0 "제국 분견대"
 KIR_imperial_detachment_idea_desc:0 "군주로서의 역할에 중요한 성격의 무형적 측면을 보존하고 홍보의 문제보다는 국가 문제에 초점을 맞추기로 한 차르의 결정은, 비록 그의 사람들 모두의 마음에 남아있지만, 그가 많은 사건에서 개인적으로 물러나는 결과를 가져왔습니다. 이것은 사회에 명백해지기 전에 차르께서 문제를 해결하고 있다는 사실을 알고 안심할 수 있는 많은 사람들에겐 의심의 여지가 없지만, 분견대를 통해 그의 지위를 대중들에게 알리려면 추가적인 노력이 필요합니다."

 KIR_kirov_vodka:0 "보드카"
 KIR_kirov_vodka_desc:0 "뱌트카 증류기는 국내에서 소비하거나 해외로 수출하거나 의료·군사적 환경에서 고품질 방부제로서 사용할 수 있는 고품질 양주를 대량 생산하여 본격 가동하고 있습니다. 비록 그것이 어떤 사람들에게는 유머러스하게 보일수 있지만, 보드카는 러시아의 주식이고, 소비되는 모든 병에 수반되는 차르에 대한 생각들로 모두가 통일의 꿈을 추구하기 위해 더 열심히 일하고 덜 낭비하도록 영감을 받게됩니다."

 KIR_modern_age_okhrana:0 "현대의 오흐라나"
 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_desc:0 "차르께서는 황실의 첩보부대와 반혁명 경찰대인 오흐라나를 현명하게 재구성 하셨습니다. 헌신적인 자원들과 국내외 적으로부터 국가를 보호한다는 이념을 바탕으로 그들은 국가의 암호화 능력을 향상시킬뿐만 아니라 적군과 당파의 공격들을 최소화하기 위하여 행동 할 것입니다. 또한 획득한 정보의 공유를 통해 현장에서 군사 지휘관의 전술적 능력을 향상시키는 데에도 기여할 것입니다."

 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_2:0 "족쇄가 채워진 오흐라나"
 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_2_desc:0 "국가 안보에 중요하긴 하지만 오흐라나는 감독 없이 운영될 수 없습니다. 이에 따라 과잉을 막기 위한 감독기구가 신설되었습니다. 이는 당연히 효율성을 떨어뜨리지만 지나친 열성행위들이 정치적 안정을 위협하지 않도록 하기 위한 대가입니다."

 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_3:0 "강화된 오흐라나"
 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_3_desc:0 "오흐라나의 끊임없는 경계심이 없었다면, 차르 정부는 오래전에 혁명가나 반역자, 혹은 그보다 더 나쁜 자들로 전락했을 것입니다. 그러므로 잠재적인 위협이 실제 위협이 되기 전에 차단하고 제거하는 것에 넓은 범위를 제공해야 합니다. 약간의 '실수'가 발생할 가능성이 높지만 국가 안보를 위해 치러야 할 작은 대가입니다."

 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_kadet:0 "족쇄가 채워진 오흐라나"
 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_kadet_desc:0 "국가 안보에 중요하긴 하지만 오흐라나는 감독 없이 운영될 수 없습니다. 이에 따라 과잉을 막기 위한 감독기구가 신설되었습니다. 이는 당연히 효율성을 떨어뜨리지만 지나친 열성행위들이 정치적 안정을 위협하지 않도록 하기 위한 대가입니다."

 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea:0 "백군의 전통"
 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea_desc:0 "차르께서는 군대의 전통을 낡고 부패하지 않은 제국주의적 전통과 직접 연결시킴으로써 러시아의 감성을 지닌 진정한 현대군의 형성을 장려해 왔습니다. 단련되었고, 자랑스럽고, 유공자적이고, 잘 조직된 군대는 많은 러시아 국적의 '무기'들보다 월등히 우위에 있으며, 유럽 러시아를 거쳐 극동으로 가는 긴 여정에 당당히 깃발을 들고 다닐 것입니다."

 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea2:0 "백군의 전통"
 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea2_desc:0 "차르께서는 군대의 전통을 낡고 부패하지 않은 제국주의적 전통과 직접 연결시킴으로써 러시아의 감성을 지닌 진정한 현대군의 형성을 장려해 왔습니다. 단련되었고, 자랑스럽고, 유공자적이고, 잘 조직된 군대는 많은 러시아 국적의 '무기'들보다 월등히 우위에 있으며, 유럽 러시아를 거쳐 극동으로 가는 긴 여정에 당당히 깃발을 들고 다닐 것입니다."

 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea_kadet:0 "백군의 전통"

 KIR_imperial_special_forces:0 "제국 특수부대"
 KIR_imperial_special_forces_desc:0 "전통에서 벗어나 현대적인 전쟁 방식에 대한 주 정부의 방향 전환의 일환으로, 전문가 구성의 선택과 훈련에 더욱 초점을 맞추고 있습니다. 이러한 초점은 확실히 특수부대의 효율성을 증가시키지만, 엄격한 조건은 적어도 일시적으로 채용을 전반적으로 감소시키는 결과를 낳았습니다."

 KIR_strength_in_numbers_idea:0 "군인 숫자 증가"
 KIR_strength_in_numbers_idea_desc:0 "고전적인 러시아 군대는 인력과 수적 우위에 초점을 맞추면서, 채용을 대폭 확대하고, 기준을 완화하며, 전통적인 영역 밖에서 신병들을 찾고 있습니다. 이것은 더 많은 병사들이 차르의 군대에 들어갈 것이라는걸 의미하지만, 그것은 또한 그들이 적어도 당분간은 훈련 프로그램이 그들의 자연적인 한계를 넘어서 확장되기 때문에 다소 비효율적일 가능성이 있다는 것을 의미하기도 합니다."

 KIR_general_staff_academy:0 "뱟카 작전 참모 아카데미"
 KIR_general_staff_academy_desc:0 "국가 군 장교를 위한 통일적이고 보편적인 훈련 커리큘럼의 구축은 예상대로 전반적인 군사력 증가를 초래했습니다. 제대로 훈련된 장교들이 공통적으로 운영되면서 행정 조직부터 긴축, 미래 장교 후보 파악까지 모든 분야에서 실력을 입증했습니다. 우리의 자신감이 커지는 중입니다."

 KIR_general_staff_academy2:0 "뱟카 작전 참모 아카데미"
 KIR_general_staff_academy2_desc:0 "국가 군 장교를 위한 통일적이고 보편적인 훈련 커리큘럼의 구축은 예상대로 전반적인 군사력 증가를 초래했습니다. 제대로 훈련된 장교들이 공통적으로 운영되면서 행정 조직부터 긴축, 미래 장교 후보 파악까지 모든 분야에서 실력을 입증했습니다. 우리의 자신감이 커지는 중입니다."

 KIR_fortified_position:0 "요새화 된 진지"
 KIR_fortified_position_desc:0 "국가는 최근 이득에 따라 영토를 통합하려는 움직임을 보이고 있습니다. 그 결과, 군대는 방어적인 목적을 지향하면서 보급선을 강화하고, 빨치산과 도적들을 제거하며, 향후 우선순위를 파악하게 되었습니다."

 KIR_archives_of_samara:0 "사마라의 기록보관서"
 KIR_archives_of_samara_desc:0 "사마라는 제 2차 세계대전 당시 소련 국가기록 보관서 역할을 했습니다. 국가가 도시를 점령하고 해당 기록물에 대한 면밀한 검토로 서러시아 혁멍전선의 성격과 대응에 대한 귀중한 통찰력을 얻어 향후 이들에 대한 전투에 도움을 줄것입니다."

 KIR_the_bridgeburners:0 "브릿지버너"
 KIR_the_bridgeburners_desc:0 "'브릿지버너'로 더 잘 알려진 특수 제국 작전부대는 적진 뒤에서 직접 작전을 수행하는 군과 오흐라나 인력으로 구성된 전문 부대입니다. 수송차들을 공격하고, 혼자있는 장교들을 암살하며, 다리를 파괴하는 그들의 활동은 병사들이 교전하기 위해 도착하기 전에도 적의 방어 능력을 방해 할 것입니다."

 KIR_solidarist_constitution:0 "제국 헌법"
 KIR_solidarist_constitution_desc:0 "정부는 부활한 러시아 제국의 첫 번째 제국 헌법 초안을 성공적으로 작성했습니다. 항목이 무엇이든, 차르와 로마노프 왕조 아래 이것은 러시아에 정치적 안정의 복귀를 증명하는 엄청난 업적입니다!"

 KIR_solidarist_economy:0 "계획경제"
 KIR_solidarist_economy_desc:0 "제국 회복 위원회의 계획에 그들의 협동주의 정책을 적용하면서, 연대주의자들은 이익집단의 투입과 산업계획 내의 집중적인 경제분야를 수용했습니다. 이것은 낭비를 줄이려는 공통의 동기가 집중되어 있기 때문에 효율성이 상승하는 이점이 있습니다."

 KIR_unionist_economy:0 "긴축정책"
 KIR_unionist_economy_desc:0 "이전의 긴축정책을 계속하면서, 제국 회복 위원회의 감독하에, 전국연합은 거의 모든 사회분야에서 정부 지출을 계속 제한해왔습니다. 정치적으로 도전적이기는 하지만, 산업의 점점 더 많은 비율이 군수적인 목적을 지향하도록 허용했습니다."

 KIR_kadet_economy:0 "자유주의 경제"
 KIR_kadet_economy_desc:0 "카데트는 제국 회복 위원회의 계획에 자유화 정책을 적용하면서 이전의 긴축 정책을 종식시키고 자유 시장 개혁을 도입했습니다. 일부 사람들은 이러한 변화들이 급진적이라고 생각하지만, 이미 그에 상응하는 생산 수준의 증가에서 보여진 상당한 경제적 확장을 촉진시켰습니다."

 KIR_reopened_universities_desc:0 "서러시아의 혼란 속에 문을 닫은 지 오래였던 대학들이 차르의 노력에 힘입어 다시 문을 열었습니다. 이미 입학에 집중한 학생들이 지원하면서 러시아 교육의 미래가 확보되었습니다."

 KIR_revitalizing_the_russian_spirit_desc:0 "국민들에게 한땐 있었던 제국의 신뢰 정신을 상기시키려는 국민 연맹의 노력은 성공적입니다. 이미 국가는 수십 년 동안 보지 못했던 희생, 근면에 대한 헌신, 차르 정부에 대한 신뢰의 증가를 관찰하고 있습니다."

 KIR_tsars_golden_purse_idea:0 "차르의 황금지갑"
 KIR_tsars_golden_purse_idea_desc:0 "차르 자신이 국가 산업 활동에 대한 개인적인 투자는 상당한 영향을 미쳤습니다. 재정적인 개선은 경제적 효율성과 산업 원재료 생산량을 직접적이고 눈에 띄게 증가 시켰습니다. 이것이 영원히 지속될 수는 없지만 가까운 장래에 예외적인 혜택입니다."

To complete our plan of academic revitalization we will replace this now-lost institution with a new one.\n\nThe Tsar has decreed the construction of a new Academy of Sciences, this time in Kazan.

Investments must be made.\n\nThe operating budget of the Academy will therefore be greatly increased, allowing it to not only graduate more officers for command, but also provide them with superior training in the many fields to which an officer must be made aware.

Both I and the other merchants have requested more guard detachments, seconded from the Imperial armies."\n\nThe Tsar hid his dismay, strong enough to break through even the intense discomfort of the migraine.

He had sent good and loyal men, men who had believed in his program of riverine trade, to their deaths. He had ignored their concerns.

Armed men under a strange banner were spotted nearby, and the soldiers quickly manned the positions they had been preparing for weeks. When the attackers - black-clad men with hateful fanaticism in their eyes - arrived, they charged headlong into the village. They were cut down where they stood.\n\nAfterwards, the soldiers assembled for a headcount, and all were present - except one.

Well, if smuggling alcohol out of Russia is their goal, they could hardly have picked better people to do it. The only question is whether or not we will accept the deal.\n\nThe Emperor's men drive a hard bargain: since the end of the Second World War, Russian-brewed vodka has been in short supply in the West. Indeed, the very first shipment received will probably pay itself back several times over. Collaboration with one of the only vestiges of monarchism in Russia would also serve to ingratiate ourselves with White émigrés, many of whom sit upon large piles of cash. The opportunities that trade with Vyatka could present to us are numerous, but so are the risks.\n\nBesides the resources that will be needed to establish the route, our greatest problem will be getting the vodka across Europe in the first place - a treacherous journey through German-occupied territory and the banditry that plagues Russia. Even as few as a dozen crates being lost per month could substantially cut into our profits. There is also the issue of the general instability of Russia as a whole. Vyatka could easily cease to exist in half a decade, and our relations with them would hardly endear us to whoever takes their place.\n\nWith all of this in mind, should we accept the Emperor's offer with a handshake, or politely turn it down and search for better opportunities?

Already the first convoy of Vyatkan vodka has been transferred to Breton control, and it will soon begin its long journey to Brittany. Once there it will be prepared for export and sold by the Bretons to whomever is willing to buy.\n\nThe Bretons have promised the first payment in a month's time, and already the Tsar's advisors are determining both the best way to invest the proceeds as well as methods to improve production should demand prove high enough.\n\nBefore long, the entire world will have heard of our Principality, and the quality of our product will ensure that they think of it fondly."

Cited were the risks of transporting the vodka across Europe and our "questionable ability to meet demand." This is a grave mistake on Brittany's part, of course, but it seems that they have made up their mind.\n\nIt seems, therefore, that our distillery will have to remain focused on domestic production. Overall this has been a major blow to our efforts to obtain foreign currency, and for the foreseeable future it seems we will have to continue relying on that which we receive from émigrés abroad.\n\nNonetheless our distillery is still proving to be a worthwhile investment, and all hope is not lost for trading our vodka abroad. Several of our closer neighbors could still prove to be interested in acquiring more alcoholic beverages, and as our power grows we could easily end up doing ourselves what we have had to rely on the Bretons for at present."

But the agents knew their task, and knew that everyone, eventually, breaks.

By the time the meeting finished, several hours later, some progress, less than was hoped but more than was feared, had been made on several of those issues.\n\nLater that evening, Vladimir thought on the events of earlier. There were differing opinions, and arguments, and debates of all kinds in between.

Berezniki, a frontier territory surrounded by radicals, was eventually pacified by Kazembek and his followers, and despite all likelihoods to the contrary the territory, now a viceroyalty of the Mladorossi, has both survived and thrived.\n\nIndeed, reports from the Tsar's representative, Boris Skosyrev, have described both significant industrial developments as well as the sustainable exploitation of local natural resources. These resources, including critical oil and petroleum products, are regularly dispatched back to the Principality, under the careful political supervision of Kazembek himself. Thus, he is crucial both to maintaining peace in and delivering resources from the region, and as long as he does that, carefully supervised by Skosyrev, he will maintain his position.\n\nDespite this, however, suspicion from members of our government towards Kazembek continues, and many say that his resource deliveries will continue only until he sees an opportunity to fully divorce himself from the Tsar's authority.

But just long enough to allow him to burn everything of value.\n\nHe signed. Kazembek had never been an agreeable choice as governor. His belief in the syncretism of monarchist ideals with communist influences was not only laughable, but also a starting point from which today's ending was inevitable. He just hoped that the Tsar would be able to reclaim the rogue territory before the religious fanatics to the north or the ideological fanatics to the south moved to claim it.\n\nTurning away from the soldiers, Skosyrev tossed one last document into the fire beside him, hefted his pack, and checked the rifle by the door.

The crime itself was not particularly rare in Russia, and was typically the responsibility of the ordinary police.Yevgeny was the first to arrive, and it took him only a few moments after proving to the suddenly skittish police officers who he was to understand why he had been called. Arriving later, Valentin understood similarly quickly.\n\nThe existence of a revolutionary cell, dedicated to the overthrow of the Tsar, had recently been discovered. The dead man, an official from the Ministry of Finance, had had his name flagged in connection to it, and having been assigned to the task force looking into the cell, they both knew, immediately, that there had to be a connection. Why this man had been killed, and by who, was still unclear.\n\nBut to do so was an enormous risk on the part of the cell, and there had to have been a reason. A reason that could be identified, understood, and followed. A reason that could, in time, lead them to the resources and connections of the cell, and thereby destroy them."
 KIR.31.a:0 "This could be more important than it seems."

 KIR.32.t:0 "Investigating the Leads"
 KIR.32.desc:0 "Valentin and Yevgeny began their investigation by searching the house where the body had been found. Following the training they had been given by Smyslovsky's instructors, they first moved to determine the place and instrument of death. That, at least, proved simple.\n\nThe man had been shot from behind in the kitchen by, judging from the wound, a small caliber pistol. The casing was bagged and would be examined to determine the type and origin of the gun. The next step was to look for evidence that might connect the man to the cell, in order to trove the suspicions of him that had arisen before his death.\n\nThis was similarly found in a box of letters. Amongst the many sent to the man from family and friends, one stood out. Sent by "Kachestvennaya Dostavka," an import/export company that operated throughout Western Russia, it indicated that the man had been involved in moving unspecified cargo for them in and out of the industrial city of Izhevsk.\n\nAnother such letter indicated that he had recently facilitated the purchase of a small warehouse for the company here Vyatka itself, and had specifically ensured that it was in a lesser-traveled part of the city. Both were promising leads, but the agents had to choose which to follow themselves."
 KIR.32.a:0 "Go to Izhevsk immediately."
 KIR.32.b:0 "To the warehouse, then."

 KIR.33.t:0 "Warehouse Clues"
 KIR.33.desc:0 "Following several days of surveillance, Valentin and Yevgeny concluded that the warehouse was deserted. So convinced, they quickly broke the look on one of the doors and entered. Inside, the cavernous space was mostly empty, and so the agents began searching the office for shipment records.\n\nIt did not take long for them to discover a lead. Amongst the many mundane manifests, a series of shipments between the Kachestvennaya Dostavka warehouse and locations in Izhvesk were found, all facilitated by the same man - Koronovanny Byrukho.\n\nAlthough the agents suspected the name to false, after noticing it in several other documents they retreated to the Okhrana offices to pour through official records. Before long, they discovered it again - in a register of addresses. Without delay, they set out to find the man with the strange name."
 KIR.33.a:0 "Let's follow the trail."

 KIR.34.t:0 "Searching the Residence"
 KIR.34.desc:0 "The residence of "Koronovannyy Bryukho" was anything but. The small house, though well-kept on the outside, was nearly bare inside, containing only the most bare necessities and little else. To the trained eyes of Valentin and Yevgeny, this meant one of two things. Either the man was an extreme ascetic or, more likely, this was a safe house.\n\nLeveraging their training and experience, they began searching the house for clues, physical or otherwise, and it did not take long before they found a well-concealed false floor panel. Underneath, a ladder descended into a crudely excavated cellar, and inside they found what they had come for.\n\nOn a desk covered in maps and folders, one in particular stood out. Stamped 'Confidential - Plan Eagle,' the papers inside the folder seemed to describe an upcoming sabotage operation against an industrial plant in Izhevsk, using materials shipped from the warehouse they had investigated earlier. Knowing time was of the essence, the agents gathered up the folders and returned to the Okhrana headquarters. They needed to report to Smyslovsky immediately."
 KIR.34.a:0 "Finally, something concrete."

 KIR.35.t:0 "The Izhevsk Connection"
 KIR.35.desc:0 "Within the Principality, the industrial city of Izhevsk is well known for its many factories that persist even in the face of German bombing. Amongst them, none were more important than the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant, and as Valentin and Yevgeny arrived in the city, they knew that if the plot did extend here, the plant was likely to be at least one of its targets.\n\nThe link between the deceased official from the Ministry of Finance and Izhevsk was one that had to be pursued, regardless of any other obtained information, and so the agents spent their day investigating every associate the man had had in the city. Other Ministry agents were gently interviewed, companies he had worked with were contacted, and offices he had worked in searched, all to no success.\n\nHowever, there remained several specific factories that had been identified in his letters, and which could still be explored. Perhaps additional leads could be found there."
 KIR.35.a:0 "Continue the search."
 KIR.35.b:0 "Alert the local authorities on the sabotage plan!"

 KIR.36.t:0 "Factory Explosion!"
 KIR.36.desc:0 "This factory, just like all the others that Valentin and Yevgeny had investigated during their time in Izhvesk, was busy. And, just like all the others, careful searches of its records had turned up nothing of interest.That changed, very suddenly, when an enormous explosion rocked the building, heaving the floor to one side and throwing the agents down to it.\n\nKnowing that the timing of the explosion was too perfect to be a coincidence, and further knowing how fortunate they truly were to be on site at the time of it, rather than arriving after the fact, the agents scrambled to recover. Running against the crowds of workers, and towards the site of the explosion, Yevgeny spotted a figure standing nearby. A figure that appeared all too calm.\n\nCalling out to Valentin, Yavgeny drew his weapon and rushed towards the figure. He knew, in the way that only an investigator can, that the figure was involved. He would not let it escape."
 KIR.36.a:0 "He has to be part of the spy ring!"

 KIR.37.t:0 "Suspicious Activity"
 KIR.37.desc:0 "Deciding to eschew investigating contacts of the murdered official and focus upon the identified plan of sabotage, Yevgeny and Valentin informed the local Okhrana bureau of the discovered plot.\n\nTogether with local agents, they assembled and dispatched small teams to many of the city's most important factories, in order to look for suspicious activity and, if detected, take immediate action. Joining one of the teams themselves, the agents found themselves watching one such factory, the primary target listed in the plan discovered in Vyatka.\n\nWith long-developed and well-practiced skills of surveillance, it was not long before Yevgeny first saw the figure first approaching, and then entering, the factory. Moving quickly, Yevgeny, Valentin, and the support team followed. As Yevgeny approached the figure, he realized that it was attaching a device to one of the factory's fuel tanks, and drew his sidearm while calling out a challenge. The figure immediately took off running.\n\nAs Yevgeny and Valentin began to give chase, the local agents moved to take care of the device, and Yevgeny gave thanks that the agents had been there to assist. He didn't want to think about what might have happened had they not been."
 KIR.37.a:0 "Catch him!"

 KIR.38.t:0 "The Chase"
 KIR.38.desc:0 "Noticing Yevgeny's approach, the figure had taken off running through the factory complex, using the myriad pipes, machines, and other obstructions to break line of sight and attempt escape. But if the figure thought such would work, he had clearly never been chased by the Okhrana.\n\nChasing the figure across a floor, through an emergency door, and down the stairwell beyond, Yevgeny was able to, for the first time, catch a good look at his quarry. The man was young, probably not out of his twenties, and clearly very physically fit besides. Fit enough that he was pulling ahead of the agent.\n\nAs Yevgeny emerged into the cold Izhvesk air, Valentin following closely behind, he knew that he would have to make a decision as to the best way to catch the likely saboteur."
 KIR.38.a:0 "Continue running behind him."
 KIR.38.b:0 "Split up and try to cut him off."

 KIR.39.t:0 "The Saboteur Escapes"
 KIR.39.desc:0 "Hoping that he had made the right choice, Yevgeny quickly instructed Valentin on what to do as he resumed his pursuit of the saboteur. Unfortunately however, and although he pushed his body to the limit, the saboteur continued to pull ahead.\n\nAs they approached the exit to the factory grounds, the saboteur grew even more distant. Yevgeny realized he had a clear shot and, knowing that it was preferable to eliminate an enemy agent if escape could not be prevented, slowed to better his aim, firing three times a moment later.\n\nOne shot found its mark, striking the saboteur in the shoulder, but before he could fire again the figure, after several stumbling steps, disappeared into shadow. Yevgeny cursed as Valentin stopped beside him, equally angry.\n\nBoth agents knew that they would mobilize the city's officers to try and find the saboteur, and both knew it was unlikely to lead to an arrest. Already the saboteur would be executing an escape plan, and within hours would be deep in the Russian forests, if not in the territory of another power altogether.\n\nYevgeny and Valentin looked at each other, sharing a grimace. This was a major defeat."
 KIR.39.a:0 "A dead end for the investigation."

 KIR.40.t:0 "Early Retirement"
 KIR.40.desc:0 "Yevgeny and Valentin stood in the office of their superior, knowing what was about to happen. They had both seen it happen to others, many times before. But, just like those others, they had always believed it would not happen to them.\n\nTheir superior heard their recounting of events. How they had been on the scene during the Izhvesk attack. How they had detected the saboteur. And then how, unforgivably, they had allowed that saboteur to escape, robbing the Okhrana of the opportunity to interrogate them and discover other members of the cell. They were dismissed soon after\n\nIt took several days before the decision was actually made, but all knew what it would be. The services of Yevgeny and Valentin would no longer be needed. They had proven themselves unable to protect the Tsar and his nation, and the Okhrana did not tolerate failures in its ranks.\n\nNow civilians, the agents would need to find a new purpose in life. A purpose that did not involve a world of secrecy and intrigue. They had shown that they did not have the skill for it."
 KIR.40.a:0 "In this environment, success is a necessity."

 KIR.41.t:0 "The Agents Reprimanded"
 KIR.41.desc:0 "Although the attempted bombing of the Izhevsk factory had been foiled, Yevgeny and Veltnin were met with a cold reception upon their return to the Okhrana headquarters.\n\nOn the surface, it had been a good week. A major attack, an attempt by a foreign-sponsored, anti-government cell to destabilize the Tsar's country had been detected and defeated. But the saboteur had escaped, and with them went any chance the Okhrana had of further penetrating, and thus defeating the cell itself. The Okhrana was not known for being kind to those who did not complete their missions to the fullest, a classification Yevgeny and Valentin found now applied to them.\n\nThey would not, despite their achievements, be acknowledged as respected defenders of the nation. No, they would be reassigned to desk jobs in a regional office, far away from capital or any investigations of importance.\n\nThey would still serve the Tsar, of course, but in a manner more befitting of their 'skills.'"
 KIR.41.a:0 "The Okhrana does not suffer fools."

 KIR.42.t:0 "The Saboteur Caught"
 KIR.42.desc:0 "Hoping that he had made the right choice, Yevgeny quickly instructed Valentin on what to do as he resumed his pursuit of the saboteur. As Yevgeny pushed himself and his body to the limit, the saboteur tried to create obstructions behind him to slow the agent down. That was a mistake.\n\nAs he ran, Yevgeny heard, in his mind, the voice of Smyslovsky cursing out another agent for doing the same thing. Trying to do so only slowed you down, he would say, and often did little to hinder pursuit. As such, and despite the obvious difference in physicality, he found himself gaining on the saboteur. He realized he had a clear shot, if he had wanted it.\n\nBut he, they, needed the man alive. He was their connection, their next link in the cell's chain. He could not be allowed to get away. And, as they approached an exit to the factory's grounds, Yevgeny saw that he would not. Suddenly appearing in front of him through herculean effort, Valentin barreled into the saboteur, knocking him flat and pinning him onto the ground.\n\nAs Yevgeny rushed forward and pressed his pistol to the saboteur's head, Valentin prepared restraints. They found themselves smiling at each other. This was a major victory."
 KIR.42.a:0 "He will talk. They always do, eventually."

 KIR.43.t:0 "Moderate Success for the Okhrana"
 KIR.43.desc:0 "The day after the factory explosion, it was important news. A terrible accident, the rough newspapers and static-filled radio stations proclaimed. But what was to the public an accident was a far more serious affair to the Okhrana.\n\nThe successful capture, and subsequent interrogation, of the saboteur allowed the Izhvesk Case, as it became known, to become the foundation by which the Okhrana moved against the revolutionary cell that had been identified some time previously. As a an agent of the cell, now known to be comprised of both infiltrators from the Revolutionary Front along with local communist and socialist dissidents, he was able to offer insight into its activities as well as identifying information about his direct contacts.\n\nAs a result of their quick actions in Izhvesk, Yevgeny and Valentin, together with many other loyal agents, were able to, in short order, make a number of additional arrests and work their way further up the chain. Before long, the ability of the cell to conduct operations was crippled, and though several members of it escaped, its ability to act as a serious threat to the Tsar's regime was destroyed.\n\nThus, despite the failure to halt the attack in Izhvesk, the Okhrana saw the overall result as a victory for themselves, for the Tsar, and for the integrity of monarchism as an institution."
 KIR.43.a:0 "Sometimes, sacrifices must be made."

 KIR.44.t:0 "Massive Win for the Okhrana"
 KIR.44.desc:0 "In a nation ravaged by civil war, espionage is a critical tool of the state. Equally important, however, is that state's defense against the espionage of others. Evidenced by their rapid, decisive, and successful action, clearly few were more skilled at providing that defense than the Okhrana.\n\nThe Izhvesk case, as it became known, was later used as a textbook example of exceptional fieldcraft. Yevgeny and Valentin had acted, using both training and intuition, to rapidly pursue the leads obtained from investigating the deceased official. In so doing, they not only prevented a serious terrorist attack at a critical manufacturing facility, but also captured the would-be saboteur for interrogation.\n\nInterrogation that soon led to the arrests of others, members all of an experienced and dedicated subversive cell. The destruction of which did much to protect the state while simultaneously blinding and blunting the efforts of its enemies.\n\nThe agents themselves were richly, if covertly given the classified nature of the entire operation, rewarded. Both elevated in rank, they worked to shape their respective departments, increasing their efficiency and skill at defending the state and, through such efforts, the Tsar himself."
 KIR.44.a:0 "Men must work for the Emperor, not against him."

 KIR.45.t:0 "Always Another Job"
 KIR.45.desc:0 ""Wetwork" was the term used for a number of the many less-savory tasks that the Okhrana was responsible for. Thus, becoming both skilled at wetwork, whatever it may be, and even better at keeping the confidence of just what was done was the primary method of acquiring the capital needed for internal advancement. This was a system that Yevgeny and Valentin did use, and had used, to great effect in their careers.\n\nSometimes the tasks were simple. Intercepting communications, raiding suspected safe-houses, interrogating denounced dissidents, and the like. Sometimes they were not. Sometimes men had to be found, run to ground, and delivered to their superiors, whatever the collateral damage to the families or friends of their quarry. Almost to a one, those men were never seen again.\n\nYes, the Okhrana valued efficiency, and Yevgeny and Valentin had mastered the art of being so, through training, practice, and long hours of actual work. What else could one call the feat of securing the critical lead in an offensive against a foreign-sponsored insurrectionist cell?\n\nWith every task completed, with every enemy neutralized, Yevgeny and Valentin advanced just that much higher in the Okhrana's hierarchy, their ultimate aim to serve and protect the Tsar, no matter the cost or consequences."

 KIR.46.desc:0 "Carefully, gingerly, Takov Rivkin placed the two candles into metal candlesticks, themselves treasured inheritances from his father. In twenty minutes, the sun would set, work would cease, and the Sabbath would begin.\n\nStriking a match, me moved to light them, the warmth in his hands reminding him of his wife and family, as well as feelings about them that he had thought long forgotten. As the candles took the light, and as the sun began to set, shadows began to dance around the room. The two points of light in front of him became blazing towers, calling him to prayer before the eyes of the Lord - and before the day of rest began.\n\n"Blessed are You, Lord our God," he began, drawing his breath deep and closing his eyes, "King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to light the Shabbat candles."\n\nThe Sabbath had begun, but Yakov did not open his eyes. He thought of the Jews of the world, so many stolen away. He thought of his wife and children, turned to ash. And as he began his final blessing, he could not stop the tears from rolling down his cheeks."
 KIR.46.a:0 "A silent prayer against the din of the world."

 KIR.47.t:0 "The Attack"
 KIR.47.desc:0 "Hearing the exclamation from behind, Yakov Rivkin thought he knew what was about to happen. The men of the Russian Protective Corps, an antisemetic band of thugs masquerading as a monarchist militia, had taken to harassing him on the street, aware of his heritage. They would insult him, block his way, and most generally act in whichever fashion caused him the most trouble. But today was to be much different. Much worse.\n\nAs they moved to surround him, he moved to walk away, but for the first time one of them grabbed his shoulder. Tightly. By the time he let go, Yakov was surrounded. And then the insults began, and Yakov grew scared. This time, they not only came faster but were also more screamed than spoken.\n\nOne of the men, a well-known scion of an uptown family that was close to the Tsar, withdrew a strip of bacon from his pocket and offered it to Yakov, only to watch him shake his head in reply.\n\nAnother of the thugs laughed. "Boris," he began, speaking to the scion, "I think the dirty Jew doesn't value your generosity." Before Yakov could speak, could try to deny the man's words, Boris had pulled a club from his belt and swung. As Yakov fell to the ground, clutching his head in pain, the rest of the men withdrew their own clubs and began swinging as well.\n\nWhen they had finished, and begun searching his body for gold, rubles, or other valuables, Yakov was unconscious. Those on the street did not intervene, scared of the influence of Boris' family.\n\nBut from a discrete corner, however, a camera captured the scene and the faces of the perpetrators. In monochrome to be sure, but also in clear definition."

The connection between the young man's father and himself was being spoken about more and more, and Vladimir knew he had to take action, and quickly. When he said as much, the young man's eyes went wide.\n\n"Sire," he began, voice trembling, "I know I have caused you both injury and concern. But I beg you to grant mercy. If not for my sake, then for my father's, who fought with you all the way from Brittany to your palace here." He swung an arm towards the window. "Our family has always been supportive of the crown, and if you grant mercy I pledge that my father, and I after him, will always be indebted to you, regardless of need. Please, majesty, do not let the matter of one Jew undo all that we have done for you."\n\nVladimir considered his words for a long moment. He had to show contrition for the injured man, of course. But Mozhayev's family was influential, and to make enemies of them, after so many years of loyalty, could inspire others to ask if their own long loyalties would be similarly treated so poorly. After a moment, he spoke.\n\n"Fine. I will be merciful. This time. It will not happen again. And now you may leave. We are busy." Falling over himself with gratitude, Mozhayev rapidly retreated as the Tsar called for a secretary to compose a letter to the injured man.\n\nHe hoped it would be enough."

He didn't think his migraine would stop until they did. Opening a desk drawer, he withdrew another painkiller from it, swallowing the pill quickly. A knock on the door a moment later refocused his attention, and he called the visitor to enter.Roman Gul, the leader of the reformists, stepped inside a moment later.\n\n"Yes?" the Tsar asked, unable to hide the exhaustion from his voice. Does the Council need something?"\n\nGul shook his head. "No, sire, not currently." He smiled and spread his hands. "They just asked me to check on you. We all know how difficult this is." A flash of embarrassment crossed the minister's face. "I wanted to say that we are all confident you did the best you could in an unexpected situation. In the Russia I remember from childhood, nobody would have even considered protesting for the rights of a Jew."\n\n"Times are different now," the Tsar replied sharply. "Clearly."\n\nGul nodded. "Yes, sire, they are. And for the better, I would say. Even if things could have perhaps been handled better at the start, I, we, know that you will do the right thing."\n\nGul opened the door again and, with a quick bow, stepped outside, leaving the Tsar with his thoughts, the sounds of the crowd outside, and his migraine.

He has claimed, however, that such assistance was not wholly voluntary on his part. Documents obtained by the Tribune make it clear that such claims are false.\n\nCopies of messages passed between the Tsar and German representatives in Brittany, the Tsar's former residence during his years of exile, detail the story of an ambitious monarch willing to compromise both his ideals and the security of his country in the pursuit of personal power.\n\nDocuments have been reprinted in their entirety within...\n\n(continued on page 2)"

Some of the functionaries began to move about. "And then," he continued, "schedule interviews with their primary competitors. We need to get our side of the story out."\n\nTo the staff arrayed around him, Gul projected confidence. But inside his own mind, he knew there would be no victory here. The allegations were out, their damage already done. And further claims were already being made.\n\nThe Tribune, along with many other anti-governmental publications that had coalesced around it, had begun publishing stories about the Tsar's family. About other aspects of his character. About Gul himself, once he was thrust into the maelstrom.\n\nHe knew that, eventually, he would be able to stop the flow of negative press. Every newspaper required access to the government to function as anything other than a seditious newsletter, and the Tribune was no exception. They would learn that in short order. But it was the time before that happened that concerned him.\n\nAnd the only person who could shorten that period, by going straight to the source of the whole matter, was the Tsar himself.

Then it was his history in Brittany. And then it was his response to those events themselves! If it had not been for the loyal service of Roman Gul, Vladimir did not think he would have made it through. But the councillor had shown his dedication, and given him good advice, besides. Advice that now rested on his desk.\n\nHe had written a personal letter to Yakov Rivkin. He had spoken of his failures, of his regrets, and he had humbly offered compensation while asking the man for forgiveness. It would get out and be reprinted, of course, and he would be again hounded for his attempts at mitigation. His attempts at concealment. But still, the Tsar knew in his heart that sending it was the right thing to do.

For all the Jews in our Empire, we shall denounce the hatred that has, for so long, harmed their livelihood and survival.\n\nOur trusted advisor, Roman Gul, had implored us since the beginning to do the 'right thing.' A nebulous concept for a monarch, who must not dwell in the morals of their actions, indeed.\n\nHowever, I dedicate this last paragraph to you, not as your Tsar, but as one person to another. I do not know if you will find this letter sufficient, but if you will allow me the opportunity to redeem my past actions I promise, in the presence of the God we both venerate in different ways, that I will try.\n\nSigned, Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov."

She had cared for him when no-one else would, and when he had told her of his plans, she had asked to come. An angel sent by God.\n\nThe journey to their new home, wherever it might be, would be long and dangerous. But Yakov was not scared. He had kept faith with God for so many years, and God had kept faith with him in return. Though he would have liked to remain.\n\nThe callous, curt letter that the Tsar had sent came to mind. Yakov understood, and indeed believed, that the Tsar himself held no hatred for him or his people. But the court had made it clear that antisemitism was still alive and well amongst Russians.

In truth he had achieved much in his leadership of the NTS, assumed upon the rapid 'departure' of his predecessor to the Komi Republic following one too many failed gambits.\n\nToday, however, he was addressing a party conference, and as he stepped up the podium his audience waited for their charismatic leader to speak. But even they did not expect him to speak so clearly about the future, and eventual goal, of the party as a whole.\n\nHe spoke about the many, myriad flaws of the communist regime. He spoke about the many, myriad flaws of the old empire. And then, at last, he spoke about a vision for the future. About a Russia reborn, built upon a strong foundation of nationalist pride and military strength, striking out to reclaim all of her constituent lands.\n\nBy the time he was finished all in attendance, himself included, could not but be certain that Russia would, inevitably, return to glory once more.

Marching towards the city centre, he made sure that all those who saw him knew that, fundamentally, he was calling for equality within the Principality.\n\nAs his march continued, he was heartened by the many citizens who expressed their support and admiration for his efforts, directly or otherwise. He hoped that, one day, Tsar Vladimir would say the same. Though he did not expect it would come soon.\n\nFor Roman, who had supported this agenda of reform ever since the establishment of the Principality after the West Russian War, leading these marches, and calling for these reforms, had become second nature. Indeed, even if he did not believe his actions to be groundbreaking, he knew that if he could just earn the favor of the Tsar and his ministers, real change could be brought to Vyatka.\n\nThe shadow of authoritarianism would be dispelled by the light of democracy, and through the establishment of a constitutional monarchy, Russia could honor its past while at the same time marching towards its future."

So few still alive remembered the times of the old Romanovs, having succumbed to age, Bukharin's communist propaganda, or the violence and war that had consumed Russia, and Shulgin believed it his duty, his purpose, to spread that knowledge once again. In his mind, if he could do so, if he could show the people an alternative to instability and strife and a pathway to greatness, he could help promote the eventual restoration of the Tsar's authority over all of Russia.\n\nAfter hours of review, Shulgin inspected his document one final time. A proud declaration of the resilience of the Russian people and the glory of monarchism, it would no doubt bolster the morale of the Principality's citizens. Shulgin was no propagandist, but he well understood that, in hard times, the people needed to be reminded of both the dedication of their Tsar to them and the similar dedication expected from them in return.\n\nShulgin believed, with every fiber of his being, that the only thing that could save Russia was a return to the empire he had once lived in, and to the strong central authority of the Tsar.\n\nWith deep respect, he signed the document and left it on his desk.

Indeed, others are being galvanized to action.\n\nOne of these others is the Tsar himself, who has read numerous reports about a sudden surge in interest in scientific pursuits, aeronautical engineering, and other elements of higher education among the populace. He has consequently encouraged expanded instruction in these fields, as much as is reasonably possible, in the Principality's schools.\n\nAnd who knows?

All Russians in his own lands would, of course. As would those, and others, in America, Japan, Germany, and Italy, when it was rebroadcast later in the day. But would it reach those Russians to the east, spread out from the Urals to the Pacific? Would the rulers there, who had largely consolidated their own realms, allow it to be? He hoped so, even if he knew the opposite was likely to be true.\n\nBut he also knew that, in time, he would reach them. Monarchism had not been popular in Russia for a long time, and yet he had triumphed here. He had made people believe in him. In the dynasty. He would help them to believe as well.\n\nHe returned his attention to the moment. Campaigns to the east were far in the future. There were still many issues to deal with here, ranging from debates of the future of democracy, to remnant partisans of the many nations and ideologies crushed under the Imperial forces, to the ever-present disputes over trade and commerce.\n\nVladimir knew that many more hard choices would have to be made to solve both them, as well as other problems.

It was the culmination of decades of work, two wars, endless political machinations, and a most regrettable collaboration with the Germans besides. But all of that was in the past, and he only had eyes for the future.\n\nMoving to sit behind the desk he began picturing the items that would soon cross it. Maps. Lists. Numbers. And more.

If they had, they might have noticed both a fire in his eyes and a surprisingly muscular figure that his somewhat tattered clothes could not entirely conceal.\n\nNikolay Rumyantsev was a man destined from birth to be a soldier. Born in the days of the old Russian Empire, he had seen the corruption and rot present in his homeland and could not accept it. Unable to stomach the army of his country, but still wanting to fight, he had therefore joined the French Foreign Legion.\n\nMarching from one desert fort to another, making friends and enemies alike, he in time saw France as his new home, and did not ever think he would return to Russia. But the war changed everything. With German victory came a malaise in the Legion, and once more Rumyantsev eventually found himself adrift. He had considered finding some other small war to die in, but defeat had awakened something long forgotten. He was a soldier, yes, but he was also a Russian.\n\nWhen word reached him of Tsar Vladimir's return, and the establishment of a monarchist state in Russia dedicated to fighting communists and fascists alike, he realized, eventually, that he had to return to the land of his birth, find his Tsar, and serve him in one last war.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, he would die as he had lived: fighting."

Factories would be repaired, the dead would be mourned, and life would carry on. But not today.\n\nToday was a day of clear skies and a contented people. The planes of the Imperial Air Force soared overhead, smoke trailing behind them as they crossed in the air, every maneuver met with a series of gasps and applause by the audience below. The display had been planned in the Tsar's honor, a show of the nascent air force's strength, but it also served as rare entertainment for the people of Vyatka. All non-vital workers were permitted to attend at no cost, though the nation had certainly given up a large share of fuel and spare parts for the event.\n\nUnfortunately for the man of the hour, the air show was a nerve wracking experience. Tsar Vladimir was proud of the fleet of planes at his command, one of the largest in Russia, but he was under no illusions as to the reality of the situation. Shoddy pre-war fighters were piloted by undertrained airmen that seemed only seconds away from crashing into one another at any given time. It was a miracle they had managed to get so many planes in the air without a disaster.\n\nStill, even as Vladimir's fingers dug into the arm of his chair, he could not deny the beauty he saw in their potential.

The young conscript wasn't wrong. The old bunker had seen better days. The underground foundations of the shelter were truly sprawling, a maze of holdfasts fit to house more than a hundred men. It had taken them the better part of a day to clear the rubble from where the roof had caved in. Now the bunker would be home to whatever men could be spared for sentry duty and the roof was a series of logs coated in mud to help keep the rain out.\n\n"It was," Kirill replied.

In fort building, that meant using old Soviet installations. If there wasn't concrete available, you looked for solid stones. If the stones weren't stable, wood made up the rest. And when there was nothing left but dirt, trenches were dug and lined with bags full of the very same soil.\n\nTheir current project was a sight better than when they had first arrived. What had started as a pile of shattered concrete and rusted metal lugs was now a half respectable redoubt on Vyatka's northern border.

Brains. He threw up. The others were yelling. More were coming? He looked over the top. They were getting closer. How many? He lifted his rifle again. Hands were shaky. Pulled the trigger. One fewer, now. He remembered to cycle the bolt. Squeeze. Click. Nothing. He looked to the others. He needed more bullets. More bullets to kill more Nazis.\n\nThey were all empty. Isaak's ears were still ringing. His comrades looked scared. They had run out of bullets before the Nazis had run out of Nazis. What do we do, they asked. Isaak did not know.

If we can extract concessions and protections from the Tsar, even as we agree to rejoin his state, we can continue to spread our beliefs in peace and security.\n\nMany senior figures in the movement have expressed support for the talks, and the only thing remaining is to see if Kazembek, whose voice carries more weight than all others combined, agrees as well."

It was being suggested by some that, owing both to their competence and their absolute opposition to communism, they could potentially be recruited into the Imperial Army. The Tsar knew that there were personal reasons for the suggestion as well - after all, many of the captured officers had once served alongside his own during the West Russian War - but there was genuine merit. Many of the generals were truly very skilled.\n\nThe suggestion was fiercely protested by other generals. Unlike both they and the Tsar himself, the men had not abandoned collaboration with the Germans until forced to do so, and they had generally fascist leanings besides. Vladimir faced a dilemma. Would he ignore the past of the ROA generals in the interests of pragmatism? Or would he conclude the cost was not worth the reward?\n\nHe had to decide."

The man was a very capable politician and administrator. And in the government he could both preach Mladorossi-influenced solutions to national problems and also identify sympathetic politicians and officials.\n\nMany officials are, unsurprisingly, critical of the suggestion to give a senior government position to one that they see as both a radical and a traitor, while others see it as a necessary concession towards the state's unification plans for Western Russia. Kazembek is no fool, and if this concession is granted prior to the Tsar's meeting with him, he will not accept a cabinet post without significant influence.\n\nThus, the central question has become whether we will accept the leader of the Mladorossi as an influential figure of our government in exchange for a decisive end to the crisis surrounding his rogue governorate."

The evidence against them, from witnesses and otherwise, was damning, and was supported to great effect using documents, carefully organized and reviewed by the Okhrana, from the archives in Samara.\n\nSeveral of the revolutionaries, long used to bombastic speeches, spoke for hours at length about their own accomplishments, the Tsar's failings, the lack of authority of the court, and many other things besides. But the outcome was never in doubt. It could not be.\n\nAs the sentences were read out, the revolutionaries looked on, stone-faced. They had sent thousands to their deaths after similar trials, and they knew what was coming. Death, for most. Lifetime imprisonment, for some. Long sentences, for a few, to allay allegations of forced harshness. They had spent their life in opposition to the concept of the Imperial state, and now it was finally punishing them.\n\nAll over Russia, both inside the Tsar's domain and without anti-communists rejoiced.

It was thus the perfect unit for him to visit.\n\nEscorted by both bodyguards and senior officers, Vladimir arrived at the battalion's camp in the early afternoon, beginning with a tour of its fortifications and general construction. Following that, he took the time to meet with the soldiers nominated for awards, and taking over responsibility from the unit commander, personally conveyed the awards to those so nominated, with pictures taken all the while.\n\nBy the time he left, later that evening, many of the battalions soldiers seemed more confident, more focused, and more determined to complete their mission.\n\nThe visit was considered a great success, not only among the troops themselves, but also in how the public began to see their Tsar - as a man willing to leave his palace and meet those actually fighting for him, in stark contrast to many of the Romanovs of old."

The syncretic ideology of monarchism and socialism that its rogue governor, Alexander Kazembek, professed was anathema to the military, and nearly to a man they advised their Tsar to give the order to prepare and execute an invasion.\n\nOther, more moderate members of government believed that those same monarchist beliefs of Kazembek could be appealed to in order to negotiate peaceful re-acquisition of the territory. They did concede, however, that some concessions would be required in order to do so.\n\nIn the end, as in nearly all things, the final decision was made by the Tsar."

They promise regional autonomy, the respect of cultural and religious tradition, and the liberalization of the Tsar's regime, believing that to do so would create a state that all could be proud to be part of.\n\nThe Conservatives, under the leadership of the old Imperial bureaucrat Vasily Shulgin, promised a return to the values of the Russian Empire. They vowed to ensure strength and stability under the guidance of a strong and centralized government watched over by an equally strong and authoritative Tsar.\n\nThe Soldarists, under the leadership of the firebrand Alexsandr Solzhenitsyn, offered an alternative direction, based on anti-communist thought.

This is a day of great rejoicing for all of the Tsar's subjects, and for all of those who desire a strong and stable Russia.

A victory, in a surprisingly clear majority, for the Constitutional-Democrats, or Kadets.\n\nMedvedev had not expected that. The Soviets had long taught that monarchism was inherently, and inexorably, reactionary. Instead, however, this new Empire seemed to be marching in the opposite direction, towards liberalism and democracy. He was not yet sure what to make of such a change, but he did know that he was looking forward to seeing what it truly meant.\n\nWith that thought, Medvedev finished his tea and went to bed.

 vyatkasuper.1.t:0 "Imperial Triumph"
 vyatkasuper.1.desc:0 "Bringing his mouth closer to the microphone, Prime Minister Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn prepared to address the nation and briefly exhort the victories of his Solidarist government in the Siberian campaigns.\n\nTsar Vladimir had departed for Omsk, where he was to inspect the captured factory complexes as well as meet with local political supporters who had kept their monarchist loyalties long- and well-hidden under the previous regimes. He would be touring many of the region's cities over the next few days, showing the people that their monarch had arrived to return them to the legitimate Russian government.\n\n"Good evening, people of the Empire," Solzhenitsyn began, "I speak to you tonight of victory in many forms. I speak to you first of military victory, as the last remnants of the enemy state have surrendered to the officers of our brave Imperial Army. I speak to you of economic victory, as production levels of consumer goods have reached their highest-ever recorded levels. I speak to you of social victory, as millions of Russians have been freed from tyranny and returned to their rightful brothers and sisters."\n\nIn the days to come, know that details of these victories will be made clear. Know also that this is not the end. There are more victories to be won - and they will be won. For now, however, be content in the victories themselves, only made possible through your continued dedication and hard work to the state, the Tsar, and to each other."\n\nSolzhenitsyn turned off the microphone and leaned back in his chair. He thought he had done rather well."

 vyatkasuper.2.t:0 "The Caged Emperor"
 vyatkasuper.2.desc:0 "Tsar Vladimir sat in his dimly-lit office, took a painkiller to deal with yet another migraine, and despaired.\n\nThings had not gone as he had expected. When he had first come to Russia, when he had led his people from the dreary lands around Vyatka to dominate over all of Western Russia, he had been a monarch with power. Real power, like the Romanovs of old. But ever since the conclusion of the Vologda Congress, that power had been taken away from him, piece by piece.\n\nThe Solidarists had triumphed, their message of national strength and reclamation resonating with the - his - people, and Solzhenitsyn had quickly moved to consolidate his government's power, both within the constitution and outside it.\n\n'Temporary' laws were passed in his name, and 'national security' initiatives restricted the rights of millions of Russians. And there was nothing he could do about it.\n\nOh, he gave speeches, visited factories, and presided over the now-defanged Council. But the speeches were delivered to him, the tours were guided, and the Council packed with Solidarist sympathizers. He knew that his ancestors would never have allowed such to happen. But, clearly, he was not like them at all.\n\nAnd so he sat in the darkness, considering who he had been, and who he would never be."

 vyatkasuper.3.t:0 "Decommunization"
 vyatkasuper.3.desc:0 "With the state's efforts towards the reclamation of further territory well underway, attention has now been given to enemies that remain within our borders.\n\nAlthough most of the millions of Russians in our nation support the Tsar and his government, there are many who still hold true to previous ideologies. In particular, there remain many adherents to the great cancer that is communism. They must be rooted out, lest the ideology that led Russia to abject ruin and tyranny resurface to do so once again.\n\nProactive measures will be taken. A combination of propaganda efforts and a national re-education campaign, along with a coordinated offensive between the Okhrana, ordinary police, and military forces, will be put into action. Communism will be destroyed, and in its place will be enshrined a new Russian spirit, marshaling the people for the bright future ahead."
 vyatkasuper.3.a:0 "Justice will be done."

 vyatkasuper.4.t:0 "Status Report"
 vyatkasuper.4.desc:0 "To Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Prime Minister:\n\nOur efforts within the newly conquered territories in Western Siberia have been met with general success, leveraging both the political and financial support generously provided by the government to identify informants, disused archives, and other sources of intelligence on the former operatives and members of the extremist organizations that formerly operated within the region.\n\nTo date, our agents have located and captured hundreds of individuals with ties to local communist parties as well as the Black League. Interrogation of these individuals, in turn, provides additional intelligence on others, and as such the pace of our efforts are accelerating.\n\nHowever, we must also report that efforts to secure local support through the use of targeted informational campaigns have proven less successful, and can likely be attributed to anti-monarchist sentiment reinforced by previous regimes. We do believe, however and despite the cost, that continuing them, until such time as they are effective, is a worthy investment. Without constant local repudiation of your government, and with additional economic investment within the region forthcoming, in time support can be achieved.\n\nWe will, in any case, continue to ensure the security of the state.\n\nYours,\nBoris Smyslovsky\nChief of the Okhrana."

 vyatkasuper.5.t:0 "A Strong Empire"
 vyatkasuper.5.desc:0 "Although many would term Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn a cruel man, the Prime Minister did not think of himself in such a way.\n\nAfter all, the Solidarists believed strongly in community and cooperation, and a natural corollary to that was acting, as strongly as necessary, against those outside that community. Which, to Solzhenitsyn, meant everyone outside of the Solidarist movement.\n\nIn stark contrast, within the movement he was seen as a hero, the one man willing to do what was necessary to ensure the safety and stability of the Empire. To do what was necessary to prepare it for the no-doubt terrible hardships and conflicts ahead. If they had known what he really thought, however, he doubted they would idolize him so.\n\nHe was well aware of his own, and his movement's, mortality. Fundamentally authoritarian, he knew that the history books of generations to come were unlikely to be kind to him. But that was a price he was willing to pay. For the moment Russia needed to be strong. Not good, or equal, or even honest. But strong. Survival was, for the foreseeable future, more important than happiness or freedom.\n\nHe looked out the window, towards the west where he knew the work crews would be moving to build the roads he had authorized earlier that day. Roads that the Imperial Army would, one day, march along towards Moscow.\n\nHis nation was strong again, and soon it would be whole. What anyone thought about him did not matter in the least."

 vyatkasuper.6.t:0 "Meeting with the Tsar"
 vyatkasuper.6.desc:0 "Vasily Shulgin, now Prime Minister Shulgin, sat in the Tsar's reception room, in preparation for his first official meeting with the monarch in his new role as the head of government. It was far, far less opulent than the one he remembered from many years ago. Perhaps that was the point.\n\nHe rose as the Tsar entered, pausing at the sight of his sovereign in attire other than the official state regalia. Wearing a relaxed shirt and comfortable shoes, he looked almost human. Something that Shulgin knew could not be countenanced outside of these private rooms.\n\nHe watched as the Tsar dismissed his valet, crossed the room, and sat in his char. "Sit, Vasily," Vladimir commanded, a slight smile on his face. Shulgin obeyed.\n\n"Majesty," he replied, "thank you for making time for me. I am most pleased to have been invited to form your government, and I pledge to serve you, and this Empire, faithfully." He could help but feel the weight, the responsibility, of those words.\n\nVladimir smiled again, and Shulgin could not help but, for a moment, see the Tsar as a boy. A boy from a family that he had failed once, long, long ago. A family that he was determined never to fail again.\n\nThe Tsar thanked him, and asked about his plans both for the cabinet and for the nation at large. It was many hours before either of the men left the room."

 vyatkasuper.7.t:0 "Wasted Potential"
 vyatkasuper.7.desc:0 "For the umpteenth time, Roman Gul again reviewed the electoral figures from the Congress. It was as if they were mocking him.\n\nHe and his Constitutional Democrats had been considered the underdogs by all, but they had proven that estimation false, performing far above predictions in nearly every district, from Arkhangelsk to Samara. They had come so close, so close to achieving a position of power from which real change could be promoted. But, in the end, it had not been enough.\n\nThe people had chosen tradition over progress, and it would not be the Kadets, but Shulgin and his Conservatives who would form government. Still, he had thought, not all was lost. Enough Kadets had been elected to constitute a major power bloc, and he had hoped they would be able to both negotiate for positive reform and obstruct stagnation, where possible. And then he had been granted a 'prestigious' appointment in Syktyvkar - by the Tsar himself.\n\nOne could not refuse an Imperial appointment, and so he had packed his bags, made his way to the conquered capital, and assumed his, as he quickly discovered, powerless post. Shulgin had sent him somewhere he could not cause trouble. Could not push his agenda. But even subjected to internal exile, Gul would not allow the ideals to which he had dedicated his life be forgotten.\n\nMany in Komi were facing discrimination, and if he filed his report on time, there remained a chance that someone with real power might do something about it.\n\nHe had gambled on longer chances before."

 vyatkasuper.8.desc:0 ""Good Evening, citizens of Russia, wherever you may be. I speak to you tonight of both your government and your future, and I hope you will spare a few moments to listen."\n\n"As I am sure you are aware, the government chosen at the Congress of Vologda has now had some time to put its policies into action. The effects of those policies have now had time to become apparent, and in working towards the ambitious future he once promised, Prime Minister Shulgin continues to possess my full confidence."\n\n"But we have not yet reached that future, and we must continue working for it. It is a future of reunification of land. A future of reunion of family and people. A future of liberation for millions living under the tyranny of occupiers and false despots alike. It is a future that we will march towards together, united in purpose."\n\n"Indeed, it is a future to which all of you have already contributed. Each of you who cast a vote, whether you be a farmer, laborer, soldier, doctor, politician, or Tsar, proved your dedication to our great nation as it emerged from its chrysalis."\n\n"The last few years have not been easy, and I cannot promise that there will not be similar hard times ahead. What I can promise, however, is that both myself and the Prime Minister will not rest until Russia is reunited, and all our people know the freedom that has now become known to you all. I ask that you keep your faith, in both him and me, until that grand day."\n\n"As I ask for your prayers, goodnight.""

 vyatkasuper.9.desc:0 "With the practiced action of one who had done so hundreds of times before, Grigory held the poster and nail against the wall with one hand, and swung the hammer with the other.\n\nHe didn't know how much impact the campaign was having, but he did know exactly how much the man from the government was paying him per poster, and that was enough. Beside him, his friend Konstantin was also putting up posters, albeit in a much more relaxed and less proficient fashion. Grigory elbowed him in the side.\n\n"Speed up!" he hissed. "If we don't get this street done within the hour they won't give us another box."\n\nKonstantin shrugged in reply. "I don't know why they're even bothering with this, you know," he said. "Nobody's even reading them. They're not going to stop calling it Sverdlovsk, so why is the mayor even doing this?"\n\nGrigory looked at him in disbelief. "You don't know? How-" he took a deep breath, and hammered another poster into the wall before continuing. "Sverdlovsk is where the Bolsheviks shot the old Tsar. They're planning a big memorial on the next anniversary, and the mayor is trying to curry favor by changing the name back from what they changed it to."\n\nKonstanin looked surprised. "Huh. I thought the old Tsar and his family were hanged in Moscow. At the end of a big trial."\n\nGrigory sighed again. "Well they weren't." He handed Konstantin half of their remaining posters. "Now quit stalling and put these up so we can get paid and go home.""

 vyatkasuper.10.desc:0 "At first Ven had been happy with the increase in business at his workshop. That was before he realized that almost all of the new customers were Russian.\n\nAn Udmurt living among the Bashkirs in Ufa, Ven knew well what it meant to be a minority. He was also very practiced at identifying the ethnic composition of the places where he lived. And that practice was telling him that there were suddenly far more Russians in Ufa than there had been only a short while before.\n\nSure, he thought, Ufa had been growing even before reunification, but not enough to attract so much Russian settlement so quickly. So quickly that, if the trend continued, ethnic Russians would constitute a plurality just in time for the municipal elections.\n\nHe looked at the envelope on the counter - a letter from his sister in Izhvesk. He had not returned to Udmurt lands in years, for he had until now very much enjoyed living in Ufa. He did not look like the Bashkirs or pray to the same god, but he had been welcomed all the same. In Ufa, all those who had lived in the Russians' shadow for so long were welcome to share in the sunlight.\n\nBut now the Russians had returned, for better or worse, and how long would it be before he was once again seen as an outsider in a Russian city? No, he would rather live among people who welcomed him as one of their own, even if it meant leaving this life behind.\n\nThe time had come to pack his bags."

 vyatkasuper.11.t:0 "The Great Mutilation"
 vyatkasuper.11.desc:0 "Applause from the crowd was thunderous as Prime Minister Vasily Shulgin crossed the stage and stepped up to the podium.\n\nWithdrawing his speech and glasses from his jacket, he looked at those arrayed in front of him, Many were ordinary citizens, but there were also representatives from every newspaper, radio station and, in a first, television stations, their cameras focusing upon him. He knew that all would hear his speech. And all would understand the enormity of what it promised.\n\n"Citizens of the Empire," he began, "tonight I speak to you about a great mutilation. A great mutilation inflicted upon Russia by forces both within and without."\n\n"Within by the Bolsheviks, who treacherously killed their Tsar and plunged the nation into darkness with their incompetence, stupidity, and bloodlust. Without by the Nazis, who carved millions of Russians away from their land, subjected them to abhorrent slavery, and stole their, and your, future besides. And I say to you, no longer!"\n\n"The Tsar, and therefore my government, will not rest until we reclaim what is rightfully ours. Until all of his subjects are liberated, and all of his lands, from Saint Petersburg to Vladivostok, are reunited and prosperous. This mutilation will be healed. Healed by you. Healed by my government. Healed by His Imperial Majesty!"\n\n"So, people of the Empire, join me in this righteous struggle! God and the Tsar stand with us, and when they join the children of the motherland, marching in unison, we are all, together, unstoppable! Russia shall be glorious once more!"\n\nThe speech continued, but in truth none could hear it, Shulgin's voice being drowned out in a cacophony of cheers."

Destruction of the horrid legacy of the hated Aryan 'Brotherhood,' a necessary task both for Russia and for those who had lived in a once-grand city that could, in time, be grand again.\n\nOn the city's outskirts, Alexander Medvedev returned home, having paid respects to his late wife. As he had every night since the election of Prime Minister Gul and his Kadets, Medvedev prepared a simple meal and sat down in front of the radio. But unlike every night, there was a speech by that same Prime Minister about to be broadcast. And, after a short transition, that speech began.\n\n"Good evening, fellow citizens," Gul began, "I speak to you tonight, as your Prime Minister, to offer a promise. A promise that I affirm before all the peoples of Russia, from Arkhangelsk to Samara, and from Moscow to Vladivostok, that you shall know a better tomorrow."\n\n"My government, working closely together with the Tsar, a man whose dedication to liberation has never wavered, will act to ensure the fundamental and deserved freedoms of every citizen in the Empire. It matters not one's faith, or culture for they, and you, be Russians all. Russians all who will, one day soon, live in peace and prosperity under the Imperial flag!"\n\nThough Medvedev's radio was a simple one, even he could hear the sincerity in Gul's words ring out across the room.

And now, as he observed the new recruits receiving their basic training, he felt a deep melancholy.\n\nHe believed in Tsar Vladimir's cause to secure a future for the lands of his ancestors, but he could not forget the lives that had already been lost in pursuit of it, and of those that would be further lost as that pursuit continued. Especially once the inevitable campaign to secure the German-occupied lands to the west began.\n\nThe boys in front of him were strong men, driven by righteous anger, and they would be well trained. But he knew that they were not ready to face the true depravity of the German menace. Not ready for the meat grinder that they would be thrown into.\n\nBut he would not allow that to stop him.

He saw it with every step.\n\nHe saw it in the complete lack of the hostile stares that had once followed him. He saw it in the absence of the thugs that had once menaced the Jewish neighborhood. And he saw it, as he entered the kosher butcher shop, on the face of Isaak, whose eyes brightened and smile widened in a way Yakov had not seen in many years.\n\n"Yakov!" Isaak exclaimed. "How are you, my friend?"\n\n"Better than I have been in a long time, Isaak." Yakov replied truthfully. The days since his vicious beating at the hands of the Russian Protective Corps had brought real change indeed, both to his life and to those of the wider Jewish population of Vyatka. "I'll take the usual again. Rahel and I are having dinner tonight." He looked through the window. "I noticed that the RPC doesn't seem to be around here anymore."\n\nIsaak chuckled in reply as he gathered Yakov's items. "Not anymore, no. The police carted them off a short while ago. The Prime Minister seems to be serious about his promises." He continued as he bagged the goods. "You know, I've started seeing more business since his election. More gentiles, even."\n\nThat surprised Yakov, even if it was most heartening.

As Vladimir welcomed him cordially and invited him to sit, Gul offered his respects, and began to speak.\n\n"Thank you, your Majesty, for this meeting. I know that you and I do not see eye to eye on many things, but I want you to know that both I and my government desire nothing more than to see the Empire brought forward into the modern age."\n\nThe Tsar nodded slowly.

I know that I, or rather we, were not likely your personal preference to form government, but we entirely share your views on the aggressive pursuit of reunification. I must stress, however, that the mistakes of the past, the rigidity of policy that allowed communism and fascism alike to divide Russia, will not be permitted to take hold again. And in order to ensure stability, the monarchy must be seen to be supportive of its government's agenda."\n\nThe Tsar was silent for a long moment, and Gul feared the worst. And then Vladimir nodded again, but this time his expression was more thoughtful. "I understand, Roman" he said, clearly having made a decision. "We shall work together."\n\nThe meeting would continue, but when it ended, many hours later, Roman Gul felt confidence, for the first time in a long time, that things were actually about to improve."

In so doing, all they accomplished, all they had ever accomplished, was to expose the state to subversive agents. To dissidents. To communists!\n\nOnce Gul was through with it, the funding that the Okhrana received would barely be enough to maintain basic operations, let alone run meaningful investigations or recruit agents. What was worse, those still sympathetic to the Okhrana's true purpose had told him that Gul intended to demand his resignation.\n\nHim! He who had build the Ohkrana from nothing to one of the most efficient and feared services Russia had ever seen. He who had protected the state and the Tsar from plots innumerous! He who had no intention, whatsoever, of resigning.\n\nBut for all of Smyslovsky's acumen in the world of intelligence, he was no politician, and when he tried to call men he thought his allies in an attempt to avoid the inevitable, none would accept his call. And so, when the call from Gul's office finally did come, he had no choice.\n\nThe Ohkrana had been gutted, and he could do nothing but accept it."

Better than expected.\n\nGul had proven a most capable administrator, and his dedication to ensuring the stability and prosperity of both the state and the Russian people could not be denied. Vladimir knew that, with or without him, the Empire would expand, and become a better place for all of its people, Russian or otherwise. It would be an Empire in which he would be proud to see his daughter grow.\n\nAs the Tsar thought of that future, however, he also thought of his past. Of the dark days of collaboration. Of decisions made in error. Of the many questions he had asked himself. And he found that he was closer than ever to answering many of them. The Empire had a long way to go, and he had an ever longer road to follow. But he would walk that road, head held high.\n\nVladimir stood, and as he did so, he saw the drawer. He suddenly realized that he had not taken a pill in many days, and realized further that he did not need to.\n\nThe migraines did not come anymore."
