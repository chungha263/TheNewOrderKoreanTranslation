 INS_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Indonesia, with Japanese help, threw off the Dutch during The Second World War. Though the feeling of victory against a long disdained foe was sweet, Indonesia was beset by insurgents of all stripes jockeying for control of the nation. Once again Japan would come to the rescue, lending their aid and guidance to the fledgling republic and it's leader; Sukarno. Independence finally declared in 1950, Indonesia has seen a torrent of governments all come and go. The sole constant has always been the steady hand of President Sukarno and his Five Principles, marking a decade of peace and prosperity. In spite of all that has been gained there remains a distant, ever present, roll of thunder that is only coming nearer."

 POLITICS_SUKARNO_DESC:0 "인도네시아의 영웅 수카르노는 인도네시아의 역사에서 그 어떤 인물과도 비교가 안됩니다. 서양의 제국주의에 의해 정복된 많은 아시아의 나라들 처럼, 인도네시아는 통일된 하나의 국가가 아니라 많은 왕국들과 부족들이 언어, 종교, 영토가 나눠진채로 서로 싸우고 있었습니다. 그러나 수카르노는 그 사단들을 좆도 아니게 바라보았고 인도네시아는 하나의 중요한 정신으로 통일된 국가가 되었습니다. 일본이 범아시아주의와 서구 열강으로부터의 해방이라는 환상을 가지고 왔을때 수카르노는 네덜란드로부터 그의 나라와 그의 국민들을 해방시킬수 있는 이전의 실패들과는 다른 기회를 보았습니다, 그리고 그는 좆같게도 멀리서 온 새로운 일본인들이 감시하는 자유 인도네시아 정부의 주역이되었습니다. \n\n수카르노는 인도네시아 국민들에게 사랑받는 인물입니다. 아무리 급진적인 이슬람교도나 반란군들도 그가 하는 행동이 잘못되었다는것 뿐, 수카르노가 이끄는 사람들에겐 신경쓰지 않겠다고 주장합니다. 수카르노 정권은 수십 년 동안 공영권에 충성해 왔지만, 인도네시아의 독립과 자유에 대한 그의 강력한 믿음은 일본에서는 더욱 의심스러워 해 문제가 되는중입니다, 그리고 수카르노는 공영권이 인도네시아에 봉사한다고 믿는 한 공영권을 믿을 것이 분명합니다. 그러나 아무리 그를 지지하는 세력이 많아도 독재자는 항상 저항세력이 있기 마련입니다.  수카르노의 혜안에도 불구하고 인도네시아는 여전히 매우 다양하며 수카르노조차 인도네시아를 하나로 뭉칠수 있을지 의심하는 사람들도 많습니다. 그래서 수카르노가 할일은 그들이 틀렸음을 증명하는 것입니다."

 INS_Shinkyoutei:0 "신 협정"
 INS_Shinkyoutei_desc:0 "When Japan aided in our liberation, they brought with them a hunger for natural resources. With this pressing need they formed the "Shinkyoutei" or 'New Deal' for Indonesia; in return for aid in modernizing the nation, a new consortium was established between the Indonesian government and the Japanese Zaibatsus that adopted this name for their grouping: SKN. Many years after Japanese support for our industrialization dried up, the Zaibatsus continue to maintain control over the lion's share of our mineral wealth and the profits from their sale."
 INS_Pembela_Tanah_Air:0 "Pembela Tanah Air"
 INS_Pembela_Tanah_Air_desc:0 "Although the reforms of Army Plan '60 went a long way to improving the abilities of our Armed Forces, we still have a long way to go if we are to do justice to Soedirman's legacy. Our command structures are divided amongst petty zones of influence, cooperation between commanders is poor, and logistics poses a major hurdle. The valiant heroes of the War of Liberation must proactively look to solve these issues for the next generation! "

Our Command structures are divided amongst petty zones of influence, cooperation between commanders is poor, and logistics a major hurdle. The valiant heroes of The War of Liberation must proactively look to solve these issues for the next generation!"
 INS_Romusha:0 "The Romusha System"
 INS_Romusha_desc:0 "First introduced during the War of Liberation, the Romusha System is a much maligned element of Indonesian society. Viewed as a necessity by the Japanese, and boon to Sukarno, this system involves levying a portion of The Population for manual labour across Indonesia and the Sphere. Workers in Indonesia face terrible conditions and marginal pay, while those unlucky to be sent abroad to work for the Japanese come back broken in body and spirit. "
 INS_Army_plan_65_modifier:0 "Army Plan '65"
 INS_Army_plan_65_modifier_desc:0 "The Indonesia Army is the fiery sword of the entire military. Our commitment to our ground troops has created a force to rival any insurgents or foreign powers that dare to attack us on our own soil."
 INS_idea_Honor_Above_All_Else:0 "Honor Above All Else"
 INS_idea_Honor_Above_All_Else_desc:0 "The Indonesian Army is a shining paragon of our nation's ideals. Strength, honor, and loyalty echo in military staff meetings and in barracks. The army will fight and die, giving everything in order to secure victory against our enemies. Woe to those that threaten Indonesia! Woe to those that threaten President Sukarno!"
 INS_purge:0 "Bureaucrats Purged"
 INS_purge:0 "President Sukarno has successfully purged the government of all its vipers and rats. He has cleared out the dark scum that filled every corridor, every office, and every mind in the great state institutions. No longer will traitors and dissidents weaken and corrupt our great nation. All officials are now patriots who know that loyalty to Indonesia is loyalty to Sukarno."
 INS_purge1:0 "Bureaucrats Purged"

He has cleared out the dark scum that filled every corridor, every office, and every mind in the great state institutions. No longer will traitors and dissidents weaken and corrupt our great nation. All officials are now patriots who know that loyalty to Indonesia is loyalty to Sukarno."
 INS_Shinkyoutei_Enhanced:0 "Strengthened Shinkyoutei"
 INS_Shinkyoutei_Enhanced_desc:0 "Since the Economic Wars, the SKN controls more of our industry than ever before. Most large corporations in Indonesia are Japanese owned. They carry great influence within our "sovereign" nation. Whether or not this arrangement is to the long term benefit of the people is unclear, but one thing is certain: right now, the wealth of Indonesia flows out of our nation into the gaping maws of Japanese monopolists and their corporations."
 INS_Shinkyoutei_Shattered:0 "Shinkyoutei Shattered"
 INS_Shinkyoutei_Shattered_desc:0 "With the end of the Economic Wars the SKN has been effectively destroyed. Once Japanese owned companies have either fled or become property of the Indonesia state. Whether or not this is to the long term benefit of the people is unclear, but one thing is certain: major Indonesian industries belong, once again, to Indonesians."
 INS_Romusha_Enhanced:0 "Entrenched Romusha"
 INS_Romusha_Enhanced_desc:0 "The Romusha, a black stain on Indonesia, has been firmly entrenched in our society. Workers are conscripted daily for difficult, back breaking labor. The death rate is high, but unemployment is low. The people are pushed to the brink of collapse. Corporations and firms routinely employ the system for large scale projects, enriching the few at the cost of the many.\n\nEveryone gives for Indonesia.\n\nEverything is given for Indonesia."
 INS_Pertamina:0 "Pertamina"
 INS_Pertamina_desc:0 "Pertamina is the nationally owned petrol company responsible for most of the oil extraction operations across Indonesia, and therefore the economic stability of the entire country."
 FRI_100_day_campaign:0 "100 Day Campaign"
 FRI_100_day_campaign_desc:0 "President Sukarno has promised that, through superior strategy, armaments, and will, the traitors will be defeated and the civil war ended within one hundred days. This has invigorated the army, giving them the strength to fight through an awful, bloody jungle war. Whether or not Sukarno can fulfil his promise is up for debate. Should the war drag on for longer than one hundred days, the consequences could be dire."
 FRI_disruption:0 "Insurgent Disruption"
 FRI_disruption_desc:0 "The Free Indonesia military has begun an insurgency campaign, utilizing partisans and guerilla tactics to harass and divide our soldiers. Their use of civilians to conduct attacks is unsurprising, yet still demoralizing for our men. Hatta retains a great deal of popular support among the citizenry, and it will be difficult to removed the insurgents while he is still alive."
 FRI_disruption1:0 "Insurgent Disruption"
 FRI_disruption1_desc:0 "The Free Indonesia military has begun an insurgency campaign, utilizing partisans and guerilla tactics to harass and divide our soldiers. Their use of civilians to conduct attacks is unsurprising, yet still demoralizing for our men. Hatta retains a great deal of popular support among the citizenry, and it will be difficult to removed the insurgents while he is still alive."
 FRI_scaled_back_rations:0 "Scaled Back Rations"
 FRI_scaled_back_rations_desc:0 "The decision to reduce rations has not been a popular one. While it has led to an increase in production, the average person has become rapidly disillusioned with the war and Sukarno's promises on an empty stomach. When the war is over, rationing will end, but the people may not be able to endure a drawn out conflict."
 FRI_more_rations:0 "More Rations"
 FRI_more_rations_desc:0 "The decision to increase rations has been incredibly popular. While it has led to a decrease in production, the average person has become increasingly supportive of the war effort and President Sukarno with a full belly. It is easy to ignore war, suffering, and death as long as one eats well."
 FRI_security_of_capture:0 "Security of Capture"
 FRI_security_of_capture_desc:0 "President Sukarno and the Indonesian Army need not fear defeat or ever consider retreat. The brave patriots of Indonesia will stand for a thousand years, behind the security of strength and stone, before they allow the traitors to gain even an inch of land. Glory to Indonesia! Glory to Sukarno!"
 FRI_security_of_capture2:0 "Security of Capture"
 FRI_security_of_capture2_desc:0 "President Sukarno and the Indonesian Army need not fear defeat or ever consider retreat. The brave patriots of Indonesia will stand for a thousand years, behind the security of strength and stone, before they allow the traitors to gain even an inch of land. Glory to Indonesia! Glory to Sukarno!"
 FRI_landfall:0 "Landfall"
 FRI_landfall_desc:0 "Indonesia is an island nation, a modern thalassocracy spread over wide, perilous oceans. If the war is to be won, our troops must be able to traverse the seas to reach their enemy. The Indonesian soldier must be prepared to fight on the seas, the beaches, and the coasts in order to secure victory. The waters will not be able to save Hatta!"
 FRI_landfall2:0 "Landfall"

 FRI_what_we_have:0 "What We Have"
 FRI_what_we_have_desc:0 "War demands much of the nation. War demands much of the people. President Sukarno knows that any and every Indonesian patriot is willing to meet those demands and then some.

Their sacrifices will pave the way to our enemy's inevitable defeat. Everything for Indonesia!"
 FRI_preparations:0 "Preparations"
 FRI_preparations_desc:0 "The greatest commander is capable of defeating their opponent before the battle is even fought. President Sukarno and his trusted generals will plan, revise, and plan again in order to ensure a rapid, efficient victory. Hatta and his cadre of traitors will be defeated, their armies smashed, their cities destroyed, and their people turned against them, before they fire even a single shot."

INS_decree_0162:0 "Decree 01/62"
INS_decree_0162_desc:0 "With the threat of even greater terrorist attacks on the horizon, President Sukarno can not afford to gamble with the safety of his state or people. He must be able to take action when the rest of the government cannot or will not. The first presidential decree of the year will, through emergency amendments to the constitution, grant him the power he needs to protect national security.\n\nDissidents in political factions, who are idealists at best and communist sympathizers at worst, may squawk with indignation and fabricate rumors about the "subversion of democracy," but it is no matter.\n\nPresident Sukarno will do what needs to be done to protect Indonesia."
INS_Coalition_building:0 "Coalition Building"
INS_Coalition_building_desc:0 "Despite President Sukarno's newly self-granted executive powers, he cannot run a government by himself. A coalition will have to be made with another party to ensure a stable and effective state in these difficult times.\n\nThe obvious choice is the conservative Masyumi Party. They are popular enough to give the government democratic legitimacy and pragmatic enough to support some of the President's more controversial plans. They do have their limits however, so it may be more wise to ally with the traditional islamist Nahdlatul Ulama Party rather than risk another governmental collapse.\n\nIn the obscured back rooms of the capital, President Sukarno has a very important decision to make."
INS_portifolio:0 "The Portfolios"
INS_portifolio_desc:0 "With the coalition forged, President Sukarno must begin the arduous work of assigning duties and responsibilities to his new found friends. Positions concerned with education, welfare, the economy, foreign policy and various other gears in the political machine will be passed to President Sukarno's allies.\n\nThere is, of course, the danger that his friends will get ahead of themselves and use their new offices to enact policy without his approval. The President could not help but notice that they eyed their new authority like rabid dogs. President Sukarno, however, knows to keep dogs on a tight leash."
INS_Changing_up_curriculum:0 "Changing Up Curriculum"
INS_Changing_up_curriculum_desc:0 "In schools around the country, children are taught math, science, history, and civics in an effort to turn them into well-rounded, intelligent adults capable of reason. This must stop immediately.\n\n Through the introduction of "old-fashioned" islamic hardliners into the education system, President Sukarno will guide our youth down a more productive path. The new reformed curriculum will teach children the importance of patriotism, obedience to one's government, and fanatical anti-communism. After all, what use are differential equations for protecting the nation?"
INS_Welfare_system:0 "The Welfare System"
INS_Welfare_system_desc:0 "Despite all of President Sukarno's assurances that Indonesia is standing on the cusp of immense wealth and prosperity, the poor, downtrodden masses cannot survive on words alone. The issue of welfare has developed with increasing urgency within the halls of the government in recent days.\n\nWill the state protect the least fortunate at the detriment of other, possibly more important ventures? Or will it stop so called "communist tyranny" with the distinct possibility of creating actual communists? The decision, like all others, falls to President Sukarno."
INS_New_infrastructure:0 "New Infrastructure"
INS_New_infrastructure_desc:0 "If hardworking Indonesian laborers are the beating heart of the economy, then the roads, train tracks, pipes, and power lines are its arteries. President Sukarno knows that if Indonesia is to be modern, the Japanese placted, and the communist insurgents defeated, then the infrastructure must be strong.\n\nA new initiative involving hefty government funding, cooperation with local and foreign corporations, and a more liberal interpretation of the Romusha System will begin the long and difficult journey towards Indonesian economic prosperity. Remember: Without President Sukarno, there can be no modern Indonesia!"
INS_New_teachers:0 "New Teachers"
INS_New_teachers_desc:0 "Simply changing up the curriculum is not enough! Some of the teachers are still corrupted by idealistic liberal principles and communist sympathies and must be replaced!\n\nA new exchange program with Saudi Arabia and the Italian protectorate of Egypt will bring educators that are much more supportive of official policy to our schools. Some may grumble about "secularism" and "overt politicization of education," but when has President Sukarno ever done anything to the detriment of Indonesia?"
INS_expanding_the_refineries:0 "Expanding The Refineries"
INS_expanding_the_refineries_desc:0 "Oil is the lifeblood of Indonesia, the Japanese Empire, and the world. President Sukarno knows that the fastest way to grow the economy is to expand the number of oil refineries. Survey teams will be dispatched across the islands in search of even the slightest trace of black gold. Machinery and workers will follow soon after them.\n\nThere will be sacrifices of course; Farms, towns, and cultural sites unfortunate enough to exist atop underground oil deposits will have to go, but President Sukarno knows what's best for Indonesia and won't let anyone, even his own people, get in his way."
INS_Taxation_Liberty:0 "Taxation & Liberty"
INS_Taxation_Liberty_desc:0 "President Sukarno has plans for Indonesia. Great plans that, unfortunately, require correspondingly great amounts of money. Thankfully a golden opportunity has presented itself.\n\nThe Indonesian middle class, still growing steadily despite years of instability, is both wealthy and a large liberal voting bloc. In order to cement loyalty among both the lower and upper classes, fund future government projects, and strike a blow against opposing political parties, President Sukarno will kill three birds with one punitive tax rate."
INS_Fighting_Back:0 "Fighting Back"
INS_Fighting_Back_desc:0 "If the people are to be protected then the communist threat must be defeated once and for all. President Sukarno will order the finest soldiers of Indonesia, exceptionally trained and equipped, to drive the yellow-bellied red menace out its dark mountain hideout and into the light of justice.\n\nPresident Sukarno will not be able to lead this brave expedition, however; There is important work in the capital that demands his attention. Rest assured though, by his hand the land will purged of communism!"
INS_Victories_Unnumbered:0 "Victories Unnumbered"
INS_Victories_Unnumbered_desc:0 "The "glorious expedition to eradicate communism" was somewhat less glorious and eradicated less communism than expected. The people, however, must be assured that President Sukarno and the army can and will shield them from communist insurgents.\n\nA new propaganda campaign has been proposed. Radio broadcasts, posters, and fabricated military reports will bend the truth to President Sukarno's wishes. The communists may not be defeated, but if the people believe they are, isn't that what really matters?"
INS_A_change_of_plan:0 "A Change of Plan"
INS_A_change_of_plan_desc:0 "With the truth revealed and the fear of communists brought back into the forefront of the people's worries, it seems the government must, for once, take definitive action.\n\nPresident Sukarno has spearheaded the initiative for military reform. Two options have been proposed. The first plan focuses exclusively on the army and is favored by the Japanese, but neglects the nascent airforce and navy. The second plan is far more ambitious and seeks to overhaul the entire military. The final choice, of course, is President Sukarno's."
INS_Taking_out_the_trash:0 "Taking Out The Trash"
INS_Taking_out_the_trash_desc:0 " It seems that communist traitors have infiltrated the government. President Sukarno can no longer trust (assuming he ever did) the intentions of opposing politicians. Thankfully, President Sukarno has a simple plan to remove traitors and get the state back on track as quickly and smoothly as possible: A purge.\n\nStarting at the top and working downward, President Sukarno will lead an investigation to vet the loyalties of each and every member of the government, or the important ones at least. There is still the question of how the purge will be conducted, however. Is President Sukarno a heavy handed strongman who will do what must be done? Or is there room for mercy and forgiveness in his Indonesia?"
INS_Cleaning_out_bureaucrats:0 "Cleaning Out Bureaucrats"
INS_Cleaning_out_bureaucrats_desc:0 "To President Sukarno's immense regret, even his own party, the PNI, can no longer be trusted. Corrupt politicians, surely taking advantage of the President's goodwill, scheme and plot in dark alleys and smoky back rooms to destroy Indonesian society. Technocrats, their psuedo-communist ways tolerated for too long, covertly push their red agenda onto the people, subjecting them to socialist tyranny.\n\nThough it pains President Sukarno to purge his own party members, many of which he knows personally, he understands that the safety of Indonesia and the power of its president are worth far more than any single man."
INS_Polishing_the_police:0 "Polishing The Police"
INS_Polishing_the_police_desc:0 "No one person wants to believe that the first line of defense against communist terror, the valiant police officers of Indonesia, are incorruptible more than President Sukarno, but in these difficult times no one can be considered truly innocent.\n\nTo maintain the thin line between freedom and red tyranny, the police force will undergo a radical reorganization, trimming excess costs, increasing public presence, and ensuring all officers are loyal to Indonesia and President Sukarno."
INS_Prune_The_governors:0 "Prune The Governors"
INS_Prune_The_governors_desc:0 "Governorship is a powerful and privileged position deserved exclusively by the best and most loyal among Indonesians. Unfortunately, it seems that even those hallowed offices have been occupied by snakes and rats.\n\nPresident Sukarno, in a display of executive power, will politely suggest that the governors of Papúa, Sulawesi, and Borneo (notable for their traitorous communist sympathies) retire, or face more extreme measures. In their place, he will appoint patriots and loyalists worthy of the title "Governor.""
INS_Uniting_The_Far_Flung_Officers:0 "Uniting the Far Flung Officers"
INS_Uniting_The_Far_Flung_Officers_desc:0 "President Sukarno is a wise, intelligent man, but unfortunately he can't run the military alone. As a result of its thalassocratic nature, Indonesia's military is divided and subdivided into a hierarchy of power spread dangerously thin. Local officers are influential members of their respective communities and their loyalty to Indonesia, and Sukarno, must be assured.\n\nLetters, impromptu visits, and the expansion of garrisons should be enough to reach the most pitiful among them. Strong wills inclined towards insurrection and dissidence will have to be handled more thoroughly, however."
INS_A_new_generation:0 "A New Generation"
INS_A_new_generation_desc:0 "With the purge wrapping up, someone will have to fill desks, positions, and offices necessary to run the government. Thanks to President Sukarno's previous investment in patriotic education, however, a new generation of Indonesians, vigilant against the dangers of communism and sedition, will rise to fill the ranks of paper-pushers and dark-suited bureaucrats.\n\nFinally, President Sukarno, firmly in control of the state and the people, will lead Indonesia into its long deserved golden age."
INS_Presidential_decree_321_65:0 "Presidential Decree no. 321/1965"
INS_Presidential_decree_321_65_desc:0 "The reforms and purges are not enough to save Indonesia. Drastic action must be taken.\n\nPresident Sukarno has drafted a new presidential decree. Like the previous, it will expand his powers, but to a far greater degree. Sukarno understands that his authority ultimately derives from the people and has arranged for his new executive powers to be put to a nationwide referendum. Sukarno isn't worried, however. He knows that the people will make the correct choice, even if they need a little assistance in doing so."
INS_Party_in_palembang:0 "Party In Palembang"
INS_Party_in_palembang_desc:0 "As the date for the referendum grows closer and closer, Sukarno must prepare the for possibility that the referendum may fail, legitimately or otherwise.

It was then he may have lost his way, becoming more complacent with the corruption plaguing the army.\n\nAs the papers would tell you, that's far from the truth.

Sukarno had tired very much of games, the people of Indonesia had thrown off all the shackles that had once bound them, it was high time that a worker could go to his job to advance in society, not just writhe under the corporate boot.\n\nWith the reogrganization of the Shinkyoutei, more wealth can go straight to the reserves of the goverment and from there back to the hands of the people. For all the Japanese took from Indonesia, it was only fair they begin to give back."

indonesia.0.desc:0 ""Hatta, I will do what I must. It's not going to be popular - no, not in the slightest, but it's the only way to save this country."\n\n"Bung, don't you see that this decree is going against what you've fought for your whole life?"\n\nThe Presidential Office rang silent. Sukarno lifted his eyes from the drafted amendments, and a look of disappointment shone on his face as he turned to his right-hand man.\n\n"My vision was an independent, free and secular Indonesia - with or without these bickering parties!"\n\nIt's not as if Sukarno's criticism of the Indonesian political environment was invalid, and in many ways he proved time and time again to be right. Both right and left, it seemed as though the political parties could only bicker and not govern, even the PNI which claimed to support his vision for Indonesia. Time and time again, Sukarno and Hatta gave their support to various coalitions, only to collapse over infighting.\n\n"You've been there yourself Hatta. Tell me. You've seen the pettiness of these politicians." said Sukarno as he rises from his seat and circles Hatta.\n\n"My job was to unite the parties Bung, not to lord over them like Stachouwer or de Jonge."\n\n"Hatta," placing his hands on his shoulders, "If it wasn't clear to you I've already made up my mind. What I'm doing is what you did seven years ago - unite the nation. It'll be a democracy, but one guided by the spirit of 1945." Sukarno offered his hand for Hatta to shake.\n\nHatta hung his head in a silent resignation. He greeted Sukarno goodbye for the evening, and left him alone. A tinge of regret fills the air in the Presidential office. In Sukarno's mind, this was all for the good of his nation - his life's work, and his blood and sweat. Nothing could ever come between him and his duty - no politician, no Sultan, no Governor-General, and no political party"

 indonesia.1.t:0 "A Change of Plan"
 indonesia.1.desc:0 "The Indonesian Armed Forces, or the APRI is a nascent military force, having its origins in the Pembela Tanah Air battalions formed by the Japanese. This arrangement was ideal for both Sukarno and the Japanese - Indonesia gets a force large enough through which it could defend itself, and small enough so that the Japanese would be able to keep tabs on what the Indonesian military is up to.\n\nAt least, it seems ideal on the surface.\n\nIn reality, the PETA battalions which form the Army's cadres are little more than a poorly equipped garrison force. Even disregarding the lack of modern and quality equipment, the Army's organisational structure of small brigades and battalions make concerted efforts ineffective, especially against the battle-hardened Communist rebels. Something has to be done, and surprisingly, Tokyo has already sent feelers signalling its approval of army reform.\n\nWhen it comes to the Navy and the Air Force however, Tokyo is a little more wary. Sukarno wants to expand Indonesia's power projection capabilities, ostensibly to exert greater military presence in the far-flung islands to the east, but Tokyo is wary of possible ulterior motives. Even ignoring Tokyo's secret disapproval of the plan, such an expansion would place an even heavier burden on the already strained national budget.\n\nSukarno knows however, that his government is the only means for Japan to exert its influence south of the equator, and most importantly provides bases for operations in the South Pacific. This leverage is helpful, but a risky move nonetheless. Ultimately, the choice lies in his hands - does Indonesia ask the Japanese to merely reform the army, or go above and beyond?"

Today, our province. Tomorrow, the whole of Java. Soon, the godless kafirun will be driven out of our lands!"\n\nBreaking the roaring applause was the national anthem, the sound followed by makeshift flags of red and white. Roses pinned on the collars of the union leaders, the Front Demokrasi Rakyat enters the fray.\n\n"Indonesia, my homeland, where my blood will stain the earth"\n\nThe municipal police steady themselves behind the barriers separating the two crowds - the Front Demokrasi Rakyat and the Masyumi.

Carrying Nasution's briefcase and reports, the young colonel stands prim and proper while the General goes through pleasantries with Sukarno.\n\nAll for show, as an air of contempt surrounds the men. The colonel keeps this to himself.\n\n"What brings you here Abdul? I thought you were out in Palembang carrying out our army reforms?"\n\n"Well, Bung, the situation in Djakarta's untenable to say the least. Last week, two Cabinet deputies were mobbed by the reds during a tour."\n\n"We can't afford to piss off the reds even more - one more crackdown and we're dead!" protested Sukarno sternly.\n\n"Really? Not enough? Do I need to fucking remind you, that Djuanda was killed by a car bomb last month?"\n\nFor once, the firebrand was resigned to silence. The colonel knows what Nasution's next move is, and brings out the files from the briefcase. Sukarno silently picks up the folders, blankly labelled "Operasi Trisula" and opens the dossiers.\n\n"It's a foolproof plan - we act now, we root out the poison at the stem."\n\nSukarno glances over at the other two dossiers, labelled "Trisula: POLRI" and "Trisula: Kabupaten". This was huge - and potentially a make or break for Sukarno. Ultimately, every branch of government will be put to scrutiny, and down to Sukarno's will. The question is, does the firebrand of Indonesia lay a merciful hand to his colleagues who fought so hard for independence, or does he consolidate his own position?\n\n"It's your choice, Bung.

The headlines were the usuals - communist guerillas in the Javanese highlands, advertisements for the latest Mitsubishi hot-rods, President Sukarno's speeches. It seems as though this would be the same old, day in, day out.\n\nAt least, until the sound of several chugging six-tonners, followed by the lead truck's beaming headlights approach the guardpost. The lead truck stops inches from the guardpost, and an Army officer exits and approaches the guardpost, while Sergeant Wibowo is awakened by the noise.\n\n"What the fuck are you doing Widjaja!

Military reports and navy scouts tell me all sorts of things - USN submarines, C-130 cargo drops, Australian infiltrators on the ground, these things threaten the very security of Indonesia!" howled the uncompromising Sukarno.\n\n"Things that you wouldn't understand." commented the President off-handedly.\n\nHatta was barely holding onto his composure. How could he say that? In his mind, Hatta instinctively knows that the next round of purges would devastate the already-fragile nation. To exert its power abroad, Djakarta depended on local, charismatic leaders such as Daud Bereu'eh in Atjeh, B.W. Lapian in Soelawesi and Johannes Latuharhary in Maluku - ostensibly loyal nationalists and allies of the Central Government, but are unbeknownst to them - at least openly, are being marked down for purges by Sukarno's ever-centralising administration.\n\nBut, the Vice-President relents - any further misstep, and he's on Sukarno's chopping block. The declaration of emergency powers has created an inalienable atmosphere of paranoia and dread, permeating Indonesian society from bottom to top. He then heaves, then almost pleadingly asks Sukarno - "Bung, you have to consider mercy - it's just not possible for you to govern. And when they go, the Communists come in - there's no talking with them."\n\nSukarno holds back on marking Nasution's order with the Presidential Seal: Hatta has a point - purging the governors on the outskirts will definitely be a huge gamble, and said success will depend on whether Nasution can deploy his forces fast enough to establish provisional governments. He then glances at the alternative plan of his own making: a lighter purge that will only target regions which are deemed to be extraordinary threats to national security, such as the wily Daud Bereu'eh in Atjeh. Sukarno's eyes shift to meet Hatta's once more, and he has made his final decision"

By removing overt propaganda from the curriculum, his men had gained a more realistic understanding of warfare as a whole.\n\nAs he turned the page, he noticed two dark suited men enter through his office door. He looked up, confused. He didn't have an appointment scheduled today.\n\n"Allow us to introduce ourselves." said the tallest of the two. He smiled but his tone was monotone and grave. "We are part of a special task force assembled by President Sukarno to ensure all parts of the military are operating smoothly."\n\nThe shorter one said nothing and glared at Gunawan.\n\n"Of course." replied Gunanwan, trying not to let his panic stain his voice. "I'm happy to allow any inspection authorized by the President to proceed without interference."\n\n"Very well then." stated the tallest one. "Let's not waste any time."\n\nHe was surprisingly polite and benign at first. He began by going over the officers' organization, recent events, and the budget. As the inspection progressed, however, he became increasingly hostile. He drilled the colonel on the ideological makeup of his officers. He openly denounced his recent training exercise as underestimating the power of the Indonesian military. The shortest man simply glared at Gunawan before leaving halfway through the inspection.\n\n"I'm afraid, Colonel Gunawan, that my report to the President will be less than positive." The tallest man's hardened gaze dug deep into the trembling colonel's eyes. "Do you understand me?"\n\nColonel Gunawan whimpered and nodded.\n\n"Good. Now to bring your administration 'up to code' so to say, there's going to have to be some changes." There was a knock at the door. "Ah, he's here already. I knew it wouldn't be hard to find."\n\nHe opened the door and let his partner, who was holding a large portrait of President Sukarno by his side, into the room.

Hatta's firebrand idealism surely would not permit him to come peacefully? Suharto's anxiety built as more time passed and no sound came from the house. Suharto was relieved to finally hear the boots on the stairs. Down came one of the officers, his hat in his hands. "We turned the whole place upsidedown, sir. The tea was warm, he just slipped out of our reach."\n\nSuharto felt his body tense, how had they failed? Suharto picked up the radio, he wasn't about to give Sukarno a reason to have him shot."

Sukarno had insisted, or rather demanded, the PA system had been tuned to the frequency 93.5, the station of the rebellion. Hatta's abrupt betrayal had obviously affected the president. The lavish parties spilling over with women and booze, those were not his friends. The Japanese businessmen he rubbed shoulders with? All superficial. All it took was one person to be ripped from him to change his entire perception of life.\n\n"To all those yearning for a free Indonesia." The simple phrase ripped Sukarno away from his thoughts. Hatta's voice, as much as Sukarno was relieved to hear, alarmed him. His message did not seem like the friendly reconciliation he expected. "I speak as someone who has seen the inner workings of the Sukarno government, a government that rose to power by using the people as stepping stones. Has Sukarno lifted you up? Have you enjoyed the amenities of the rest of the world? No, every rupiah made is funneled back to the state, to the pocket of Sukarno. While you live in disease-infested shacks, he dines with the very men who pillaged this country two decades back! Sukarno would have you believe that there exists only two options, the continuation of his regime, or the destruction of Indonesia as we know it. My friends, Indonesia as we know it deserves to die. This is not the nation promised to you nor the one you deserve. I present an alternative, an opportunity to tear this nation down from the foundation and build a new one from its ashes. A free republic that is the envy of Asia, not the stain."\n\nAs quickly as he appeared, Hatta was gone. Sukarno was left with static once again. He stared into the radio, hoping to find the face of Hatta, his friend. Only static. If Hatta had harboured these feelings from the beginning, perhaps Suharto was not scheming, maybe Hatta was the enemy. Sukarno refused to touch the dial, the static continuing to reverberate out of the speakers, but it could not drown out the president's thoughts."

In reality, Pancasila was nothing more than wasted breath. Sukarno would fulfill none of his obligations, it was his folly. For all Sukanro believed in, the execution of his ideas left much to be desired. That's what would set them apart; the execution.\n\n"Oppressed people of Indonesia! Your presence here means something monumental, today we show that Sukarno and the Jakarta clique do not hold full control over the people! You have come here for one simple reason, to see change brought to Indonesia. You may be surprised to learn that standing shoulder to shoulder with you, the left and the right are in attendance today. I point this out for a simple reason, you did not even notice. The factionalism that Sukarno decries is what he preaches to the people as well. What Indonesia needs is a democracy that responds to the will of the people solely, which means hearing all sides, not just Masyumi and Ulama. It is because so many have been shut out of the current government that myself and our allies from across the spectrum have come together to form a new one, one prepared to bring Indonesia on par with the modern world, not leaving us in the dust with the authoritarian stereotype of Asia!"\n\nHatta grinned as he crowd erupted into applause, but he felt the same pit open up in his stomach, there really was no turning back now, Waving to the people, Hatta saw Indonesia for what it really was, not a man, not a general, not a president, but a collection of different people coming together to live in harmony. The sight eased his fears, all of this was worth fighting for."

How he yearned to be back in Palembang, to be back in the good graces of the people, but Sukarno wasn't in Palembang, he was vacantly staring at the mayor of Jakarta.\n\nSukarno watched from his chair as the mayor rattled off the typical script, how the prosperity of the city stemmed from the drive to put Indonesia on the map, questioning where would be if it weren't for the principles enshrined in the Charter of Jakarta. Something caught his attention, something unapproved said by the mayor, "What we owe little to is the Sukarno government," The unfinished statement drew a collective gasp from the crowd and reanimated the apathetic Sukarno. "A government of mismanagement and waste, one of repression and subversion!" The crowd turned their puzzled gaze to Sukarno.\n\nNo. This was not going to slide, not at a time like this. Sukarno casually stood up and sauntered to the trembling official, placing a hand on his back. "There we have it! It seems to me that the opposition is getting weaker with their slander!" Sukarno chuckled, smiling to the confused audience. "I'm curious to know how I've caused any suffering, I've presided under unheard-of growth, not just economically! We have grown as people as well have we not? I remember a time when the only opposition to the government," Sukarno turned to the mayor, "Was quickly disposed of.""

He dreaded staying late in the Merdeka Palace so it was best to get his daily tasks done early. He checked his watch, it had to have been at least three. It was only noon. Sukarno sighed and stood from his chair, he needed a break. He walked to the window, a change of scenery would help him. The scenery before him did anything but.\n\nThere were at least two thousand he'd say, their signs hoisted high into the air. "Down with the Ramah tyrant!" read one of them. Sukarno scoffed to himself, finding humor in a situation that would leave many leaders trembling, that was the reputation he had built? A friendly tyrant? What was so wrong with that? The crowd festered in the lawn, shouting chants for resignation, singing songs from the war of independence, and parading around in circles. He clenched his fists as the guards did nothing but standby as the demonstrators' numbers swelled. Sukarno, for all of his rash decisions and brazen actions, was still a man of history, he had seen this song and dance too many times to allow this to continue. Sukarno marched over to his desk and picked up the phone. The buck stops here.\n\n"Suharto? Get off your ass and get outside, I want you to keep a close eye on these people, no funny business." Sukarno slammed the phone back into its cradle and returned to the window. He watched a mother clutch her child who held a sign in his fat hands. Sukarno frowned to himself. He was fighting for these people, why did they feel the need to push back? He glanced to the phone, perhaps it was better to just let them go about it, then he remembered the slippery slope that could lead down.

The Ulama-Masyumi coalition would hold, he had made sure of it.\n\n"We do not stand alone, President Karno," shouted the representative as he stood at the podium in front of Sukarno and his cabinet, "Far from it! Those who stand for freedom, rise now!" In a calculated move, many pushed back their seats and rose to their feet, prompting a raise of the eyebrow from Sukarno. It was more than he expected, but far from career-ending. It almost made him laugh, the opposition was not the political powerhouse it acted like it was. All theatrics from politicians, it only reaffirmed Sukarno's beliefs. He cast his gaze towards a few of the more concerning representatives, ones who may be easily swayed, and found most standing. He gritted his teeth, the coalition must hold, he needed the power from the assembly to continue his campaign against Hatta.\n\n"Do you see that, Mr. President? Your actions have forced even the most bitter enemies to unite, when will you come back to the negotiating table? When this nation is a smoldering pile of ashes or when there is still time to bring Indonesia to the glory you desire?" The representative slammed his papers on the podium and returned to his seat, with half of the assembly politely applauding, and the other scowling at the man.\n\nWell, thought Sukarno as he rose from his seat, if they wanted an answer he'd be happy to give one to them.

In a nation teetering on the brink of collapse what the people needed more than ever was not extremism, just something simple, a sign that the government was still functioning.\n\nSukarno was never one for simple, preferring the more extravagant things in life. When he commissioned the Bung Karno Bridge, he demanded only the best and who produced the best goods in Asia? The Japanese. So the Fuji Heavy Industries company was selected to commemorate the brilliant work of Sukarno. Unfortunately for the oblivious Sukarno, Fuji Heavy Industries had little experience when it came to bridge-building, dragging on the project for years. Today, the proud construction workers look on as general Ahmad Yani prepared to officially open the bridge.\n\n"Now more than ever, we need peace."

This did little to hinder his movement, the people only needed to look outside the window to see how far Sukarno got them. This was an unusual occasion however, Bung was acting erratic, making choices he would never dream of doing. It was no question where the mayor went, it was not up in the air whether or not it was democratic to break up the protest, the people were not blind. A matter fact most of them had never been so keenly aware of the failures of their government\n\nAs Hatta prepared once again to speak before the nation, he knew the implications of what could happen should push come to shove. Yet, the iron was hot and there was no better time to strike. Hatta opened his mouth and spoke into the microphone, his message being broadcasted at a protest numbering in the tens of thousands. Hatta, safe from his room, spoke passionately of the future to come, for what Indonesia could be made into, and what would be left behind. His voice strained from the speeches but more was caught in his throat, it was doubt. The crowds Sukarno pulled would humble president or prime minister the world around. Hatta shook the negativity from his mind, it only meant he needed to work harder, nothing worth fighting for was easy.\n\nWhile Hatta accepted the necessity of conflict, those in the streets of Jakarta who stood face to face with the police felt their own doubts. They wanted something better but was this the best way to achieve it? As men shouted to stand down, one boy, bearly twenty, had decided that it was the only way.

Sukarno briskly hustled through the corridors of the assembly, he had an act of his own in mind. Game over Hatta, your little adventure is over.\n\nThe legislators skimmed over the act before them while Sukarno orated from atop the podium, casting spells with his arms, enchanting his message to his opponents, the tactic he had used to get him thus far. He shouted for Merdeka! He harkened back to the days of the Dutch! He spun a tale of a freshly united nation doomed to fall back into the same unorganized squabbling tribes and kingdoms that had made them easy pickings for the imperialists. He bled the story of Indonesia, out of every pore of his body not only oozed unrivaled nationalism, but the acute observer could pick up on the desperation in his voice.\n\nAs Sukarno, as Indonesia, deflated before the representatives, having no more left to give, he mustered all that was left in him to one last cry, demanding the approval of the act before them. Sukarno's laboured breathing was the only sound in the assembly. In the quiet, Sukarno met eyes with his enemies and friends, pleading for them to put nation above politics. Although it seemed like they sat in silence for centuries, eventually it was time for a decision. Sukarno watched anxiously as part of the room rose in affirmation, the other in negation, and a slim few abstaining.

A Mitsubishi automobile, bearing the anonymous license plates of the Indonesian President's luxury car, pierced the curtain, threading its way through the jumble and tapestry that was the capital's street plan. \n\nA hand cranked the side-view window open. Puffs of smoke followed, joining the syrupy mix of vapors, industrial smog, and watery mist that made up Jakarta's atmosphere.\n\n"You enjoying that cigar," a thick, heavyset voice boomed from the driver's seat, "sir?"\n\n"Very." Under the low, evening light, and the segmented radiance of the streetlamps, the President of Indonesia sat in the rear of the car, dressed in a cheap, beige suit. A fedora chaperoned his thinning hairline. "You always find the finest stuff, don't you, Bagus? Good name. Good man. Your parents must've been proud."\n\n"I only aim to please," Bagus said, his tone full of viscous, unctuous satisfaction, "sir." He looked ahead. Their destination was getting closer, as the red, gleaming letters of Hotel Harris beamed ahead, spattering the grey mist with promises of carnal fulfillment. Bagus's foot gently pressed the brakes, and with a slow, subdued screech, the car ground to a halt.\n\nBagus got out first, before opening the rear doors for the President. "I hope you have fun, sir." The President answered him with a quiet nod and stepped into the hotel. Bagus saw the beige suit disappear behind the silhouette of the rotating doors.

It was just nice to get out of the Palace.\n\nAfter an eternity of waiting, the distant roar of the engine shook Sukarno from his near slumber. About damn time. "Americans," Sukarno muttered to himself, "Always twenety minutes behind the rest of us." The sleek, jet black, motorcade made itself visible as it came over the hill. Sukarno could barely make out the man inside, was that Arief? Impossible! He knew that he went to America after war but the CIA? That seemed a little far fetched considering Sukarno's history with the boy who had almost gotten himself killed more than once. He was more trouble than he was worth in the Tentara Nasional, but Sukarno still felt some obiligation to the boy. Arief was the one who had saved Sukarno's life during a PKI terrorist attack. Sukarno retrieved his sunglasses from his pocket and put them on, well then, let's see how the boy has done in Hollywood then.\n\n"Hey Bung," the suited man said, "Long time no see."\n\n"Well, that was the point."

"Sir," she said, an innocent smile on her lips, "a message, from the Japanese embassy." She laid a beige-tinted slip of paper before him, as he tried to rub the drowsiness out of his eyes.

It was a matter that had long been at the top of the agenda, only to be tabled for later discussion, be it because of apathy or just because no one was quite sure what to do. Ulama had been the party to bring the issue back to the limelight, but it was not because of any newfound compassion for children, no, Ulama and Masyumi stood as the only two parties with the power to do much. Sukarno had banned most other parties two years prior, he had made it within his power to dismantle any party he found harmful to the continuation of the nation. The two parties could not risk infighting under any circumstance, so the biggest issues would be ironed out first.\n\nHadikusum was relieved to see the teachers step down from the podium, having made their case for what changes needed to be made to transform Indonesia into the best nation it can be. Their proposals were simple, they needed more funding and a standardized curriculum. The answer to the first request was simple, they could throw a few extra Rupiah towards the schools, but the matter of the curriculum was surely one to divide the coalition.\n\nThe representative from Ulama rose to make their case, laying out the case for an education system that kept the best of both worlds, maintaining fierce patriotic views, while also ensuring the right of the educator to separate religion and education.\n\nHadikusum countered with the proposal his party crafted.

While the outside observer might tell you this is the peak of acting, any resident of Indonesia would happily correct them, knowing that the greatest acts were performed in the Assembly.\n\n There are two things in Indonesia nobody wants to be; a politician and someone on the wrong side of Sukarno, although they often overlapped. The punishment for the former was your own doing, people would choose to wake up every morning and decide to represent their community. In reality, very little representing would take place in Jakarta. When one passed through the gates of the Assembly, they stepped not onto the beautiful marble flooring, but straight on to the high wire. From then on, the challenge was not to sway the Assembly to act at the will of the constituents, but to avoid sparking the ire of the director of the worlds biggest act; Bung Karno.\n\nNo one will be content with watching a boring performance and it'll only be a matter of time before they demand their government makes real changes. This demands the coalition to clash every now and then, even if it's for the smallest issue, only to paint the picture of power resting in the assembly."

His dry mouth recited the words with a carefully restrained panic. Across the table, President Sukarno, Vice President Hatta, and General Suharto listened carefully, holding every word like a fragile, valuable glass figurine.\n\nHe finally finished, muttering the last unimportant political niceties into a mumbled slur. The expensively furnished meeting room, caked with a fine layer of dust, was still and silent save for the gentle turning of a ceiling fan. Hatta coughed, and then began to speak.\n\n"The growing economic instability in Japan and across the Sphere clearly represents a-"\n\n"It represents an opportunity." Suharto interrupted. "An opportunity to assert ourselves."\n\n"You're damn right it does." Sukarno stated, his face implacable and his eyes shadowed by sunglasses, despite the fact the meeting was indoors. "This is our chance to seize the SKN for the good of Indonesia."\n\n"You mean... total nationalization?" Suharto gaped. "I don't think that's necessary. We can pressure them and get a better deal now that we're no longer fresh out of a war."\n\nSuwiryo shook his head furiously.\n\n"The Japanese may seem weak now, but when this..." He gestures to the pile of papers on the table. "crisis is over, they're sure to police us twice as hard if we do anything now."\n\nMiles away from the bickering figures, Hatta keeps his head cool and mouth shut, aware that nothing he says will change a thing."

In fact, Hatta had not even been informed when the meeting time had surprisingly changed the day before.\n\n"But that's unimportant right now." continued Suwiryo. He waved his hand as though to fend off further inquiries. "What's important right now is securing Indonesia's future. I promise you that, with your support, I will provide liquid investment in the economy and ensure a healthy business relationship with the Japanese once things in Tokyo have settled down. All we have to do is work with the SKN rather than against them."\n\nHe prattled off numbers, statistics, and verbal descriptions of various charts and graphs. He forgot about the meeting. He forgot about Sukarno. He retreated into a fantasy of stimulus packages, the long run effects on interest rates, and the value of the Indonesian Rupiah.\n\nAfter half an hour of economic jargon Sukarno finally interrupted him.\n\n"You seem sure of your plan, Minister." he said, carefully rolling each word in his mouth.

The President, alone with the unnoteworthy exception of Minister Suwiryo, felt uncomfortably like the table in front of him.\n\n"So," the apparent ringleader of the businessman began, flashing a carefully manufactured smile. "We were absolutely delighted by your invitation to open negotiations. My associates and I will do everything in our power to make Indonesia a business friendly environment. With a few adjustments to legislation, some special economic privileges, and a synergistic approach to collaborative innovation and problem solving, Indonesia will transform from a primitive backwater to a model of Pan Asian triumph!"\n\nAs the perfectly dressed businessman finished his performance and his associates gave practiced nods and smiles, President Sukarno of Indonesia - apparently a primitive backwater in dire, urgent need of ruthless Japanese exploitation - decided to put on a show of his own. He slowly stood up and placed his hands on the old, wooden table. Though shorter than the smallest Japanese representative, he seemed to take up half the room. His figure cast an imposing shadow in the afternoon sunlight.\n\n"Indonesia will be strong with or without your assistance." he boomed, though it was not yet a shout. "There is profit to be made here, but you will not rape our land and people. We will meet tomorrow at the same time." He looked with disgust at the austere meeting room. "And we will hold the meeting in my personal conference room." He waved his hand and sat back down.

No doubt Sukarno would love them, Suwiryo mentally scoffed.\n\nNo doubt Sukarno would love them.\n\nSuwiryo blinked as the deepest, oldest, reptilian matter of his brain whirred into action.

Ramshackle huts had sprung up around the black gold, full of workers that had moved, voluntarily or otherwise, to serve as unskilled labor.\n\nHe regarded the Indonesians, the people that bowed when he walked past, that died so often building the machines he operated, that suffered extreme poverty, like one would consider a strange insect on the sidewalk. He finished his bento and started towards the oil well: his shift started in half an hour, but he had no desire to stick around. An Indonesian boy, no older than 13, ducked out of a large pile of scrap metal and called to him. Before he could pretend to ignore him, the boy ran up to Uyeda and started shaking his hand and speaking in Indonesian.\n\n"Thanks... father... work..."\n\nThe words flew over his head. Uyeda hadn't been entirely truthful with his employers concerning his proficiency in Indonesian. He knew enough to order around the workers at the oil well, but that was it.\n\n"Slow." Uyeda said, holding up his hands. "Slow, please."\n\nThe boy repeated himself again, slower than before. "Thanks... father... job... work... money... food... thanks..."\n\nUyeda pointed at the oil well. "Father work oil?"\n\nThe boy, resorting to the universality of the human face, smiled and nodded. He patted his stomach and held his palms against one another close to his cheek, miming sleep. He shook Uyeda's hand one more time before running back to town.\n\nUyeda watched the boy run off. He took another, newer look at the Indonesian town. For the first time since he had left Japan, he saw the people living there."

Suharto asked, a little quickly. "How much money?"\n\nSuwiryo smiled again, drew a pen from his coat, and wrote a figure on his napkin which he passed to Suharto. Suharto felt his jaw loosen and eyes widen.\n\n"We could overhaul the military with this. New equipment, new infrastructure, new everything."\n\n"The military is bloated enough." Sukarno stated.

Not a reckless plan of fiery rhetoric, but a calm, collected phone call, like adults, not children as heads of state with no goal beyond searching for scapegoat and speaking to the people of the greatness of a country he was instrumental in bringing down to the level of the rump states of Asia. Indonesians are not savages, but he could not blame the world for perceiving them as so when they were led by a glorified frat boy with an ego the size of Sumatra.\n\nA click on the other end. "This is-" The cheery voice of the receptionist was quickly superseded by an irritated man.\n\n"Gimme that, gimme that! Get out, out! I'm here, sorry for that."\n\n"No problem my friend, good to hear from you, you're in good health?"\n\n"Well, not-"\n\n"Great! Great! Love to hear it, so I'm calling about the future of the SKN in Indonesia. We both know you aren't," He cleared his throat, "In a position to maintain this system with the tribulations back home."\n\n"So what you've called to tell me to get lost?"\n\n"Far from it. I want to work with you. Sukarno doesn't. I'm offering a 50-50 split. However, we have to make it look like we are coming out on top. You understand yes?" Before the man on the other end got a chance to answer, he spoke. "Great. Expect a call later." He placed the phone back into its cradle. Suharto took a drag from his cigarette, all in day's work."

 indonesia.212.t:0 "Working The Night Shift"
 indonesia.212.desc:0 ""Have a good night, sir." Tipping his hat, Gede offered a slight smile to the last of the suits. Watching over the complex at night was one of the easier jobs available. Officially listed as a "Vital Infrastructure Watchman", strolling around the largest bank in Java was hardly vital and the only thing he really watched was the sheep in his brain as he drifted off to sleep. Gede rose from behind his desk and marched to the door. Where were his keys? He patted himself down looking for them, shimmying around, hoping to hear the jingle of the keys, all to no avail. With a shrug, Gede resigned from the search, who was stupid enough to break in here?\n\n"The PKI," Gede nearly jumped out of his skin. "Seems like they've been poking around the area, someone saw some kids beating up a shop down the road, spray painting PKI shit, the usual." The voice from the walkie talkie seemed bored and disinterested at least. Gede's biggest obstacle was staying awake, he'd never dealt with hooligans, terrorists he guessed he should call them.\n\n Mustering his most confident voice, Gede answered back,"All good here, I'll keep an eye out on them." Readjusting his belt, the watchman returned to his rounds, lock the doors, turn off the lights, and sit in the main office until the morning shift arrived. How hard was that? He approached the black door and reached for his keys. "Oh fuck me." he whispered under his breath, he still had no idea where his keys were. Whatever, nothing would happen, it'll be fine, just some kids. He turned on his heel but only got a few feet before the slam of the door behind him froze him in place. Gede stood staring straight forward for a long time, not moving.\n\n"Nice going. Left the door wide open." A voice from behind him called. "You should know better, Gede." How did they know his name? "Unfortunately, your performance here tonight is not up to our standards by any margin." The slender body of his boss slinked out from behind him, "Miserable really, what if this was real Gede? We could've lost everything! Leave your badge on the desk please.""

 indonesia.213.desc:0 "What was Indonesia? The thought wandered around the curious child's mind as he watched the warriors go from home to home. He couldn't understand everything they said, he couldn't understand any of it but the way they spoke, it was clear they were nervous. The young boy retreated from the doorframe, the warriors would come to his home soon.\n\nHis father was doing...something. What, he couldn't be quite sure, but he always was protective of the basement. "Do not enter this part of the house," His father would instruct, "You must never go here." He didn't have much hair left, his father, but he was hellbent to rip out the rest. Ripping and tearing at his balding head at its very seams, his father paced, left to right and right to left and left to right and stop. He paused, for a breath? For peace? To break the monotony? To think. His father had stopped to think. The door before him led to a series of stairs, at the bottom of which was the certificate of his death, everything they needed, not that they needed an excuse anyways, to be shot. The father looked to his son, staring quizzically at him. "Go boy, nothing for you here."\n\n"Who are those people? What is a Indonesia?"\n\nThe bond between a father and son is unbreakable, he would never wish ill upon his kin, it was the whole reason he had barracaided the door, and yet, if looks could kill the boy would've been rendered nothing more than a evicerated sack of meat. "Indonesia is a vile creature." the father commanded, "Sick and twisted it is and brutal in its oppression. It's why I do what I do. It's why I am who I am. It's why you may never enter this room. If those men tell you to disobey me will you?" The boy shook his head. "Good." He leaned in and planted a kiss on the forehead of the boy, "One day I promise I will let you read, let you know, let you be free. But so long as those men are out there," He turned his head out to the window, "you will never be free.""

All of them fake until they weren't, impossible until Budi sat beside his youngest son, his fifth and seventh daughter, his wife, mother, and a very pleased government official, all huddled around a box, a television as they called it, top of the line even in Japan and America, the official assured him.\n\nThe already crowded room harbored another guest, one of prestige and power, a hero stood proudly before his children in all his black and white glory. His eldest, always the questioner, turned to his father, his mouth agape for sometime before finally struggling out a simple phrase, "I don't understand." The sheer astonishment of the young man provoked a chuckle from the bureaucrat, who simply smiled and flashed him a look to say, "I don't know either! And I'm loving every bit!"\n\n"We are Indonesians!" The box so bluntly proclaimed, "Is that phrase not liberating to say? For once, we are not divided by foreigners along arbitrary lines! The way I see it, I see a people who have been featured, who have seen hardships! Suffering like no other! We have seen doubt, discourage, and disunity! We have writhed in agony for centuries as our people have been denied the right to shout who they are from the top of their lungs with pride!" The box stopped to breathe, it's black and white picture blurring in and out of vision. "I am not ashamed to be Indonesian. Neither should you. If you are seeing this you are witnessing a revolution, not one too dissimilar from the ones ages ago now it feels. This revolution, like the last, will bring us together. I'm proud to call the National Brodcast Division an idea of my own, but more so I'm proud to provide you a way to show your pride, connect with your fellow countrymen, but most importantly keep us united, for together, we are undefeatable! Merdeka!"\n\nSlowly, the box changed its picture, altering and changing until the President was gone and nothing but the proud flag of Indonesia flew."

Sukarno savored the shimmering sun as he stood for minutes on end, smiling out into the sea of people before him. He raised a hand, a grin plastered on his face, and man by man, the crowd returned to as they were, eager, ready to listen.\n\n"I made my pleadge to you as president to present you with news good and bad, our victories and losses. I have also promised you nothing but truth, prosperity, and justice. I stand before you today and ask one simple question, have I delivered?" What's incredible about crowds is how quickly they become one entity, one body, one soul. Together, the body screamed, showering Sukarno with their praise, and he drank every last drop. "I come to you with yet another victory today." He continued, "Today, we claim victory in the first battle in the war against poverty! I proudly plant the flag of Indonesia in the rotting corpse of suffering, of inequality, for we are one people, one Indonesia!" Most didn't know what poverty was, let alone victory, and yet the genuine smile of the president told them a story thousands of chapters long, it taught them that something beautiful and rare stood before them, a friend.\n\nHe hated to close a speech, he'd drag on forever if he could, just to recount where he had eaten today if he had the time, before him were his people and he would speak to his people. Yet even Sukarno must bow to the bureaucracy and with one last gulp, he soaked in the last of their affection. "Well done." Suharto nodded as Sukarno ducked back into the presidential motorcade.\n\n"I deserve more time, Hatta always lets me-" Sukarno, perhaps drunk on his excitement, had hardly noticed the absence of his Vice President and confidant. "Where is Hatta?"\n\n"It was a good speech Mr. President" Suharto assured, his eyes fixated on the road before them."

 indonesia.216.desc:0 "When Sukarno saw Mohammad Hatta sit across from him, he would not describe him as kind or a teacher as he so commonly was. He sensed rage, he felt the disdain seep out of his eyes and begin to fill the room, drowning Sukarno in hate that he could not comprehend.\n\n"Have I wronged you?" Hatta struck first, his tone authoritative. "Help me understand, what did I do?"\n\nSukarno failed to stifle a smile, how could he? What was he on about? "Hatta, I-I guess I don't understand. You come into my office and plop yourself down in this chair and sulk, why?"\n\n"You'd know if you'd read my letters, or met me where planned, or even answered the damn phone!" Hatta slammed the table and rose from his seat, his nostrils flaring as he huffed and puffed.\n\nSukarno rose slowly from his seat, pushing back the chair, and placed one hand on the shoulder of his Vice President and friend, "Hatta, believe me when I say I have no idea what you're talking about. I've noticed your absence, but assumed you were simply on vacation."\n\nVaction? Hatta chewed on the word as his he focused on the eyes of the man across him. "I don't understand then, you haven't gotten a single letter?" Sukarno shook his head. "Well, I, uh, suppose," Hatta gently returned to his seat. "I suppose I don't understand."\n\nSeeing Hatta's confusion chipped away at Sukarno's lighthearted demeanor, genuinely confusing him. "I don't either." He said, his booming voice rendered little more than a weak whisper. The two stared a long time at each other, speaking a silent language. If Sukarno wasn't subverting Hatta and Hatta wasn't dodging Sukarno, someone else was. Neither knew who and frankly neither wanted to, the thought alone shook them both to their very cores."

Had we had it our way, Indonesia would've continued down the path of success and prosperity. Everything seemed so perfect, only to be ripped away by an opportunistic friend turned snake.\n\nGeneral Suharto has not just drafted a plan, he has meticulously planned out the demise of the breakaway republic to the smallest and most insignificant detail."
 INS_The_Blockade:0 "The Blockade"
 INS_The_Blockade_desc:0 "Sukarno is no idiot. He understood long ago that of conflict were to come to Indonesia proper, most of the fighting wouldn't take place in the cities or the jungles, but rather the oceans. Indonesia is a complex body, it's organs spread out and the nerve system wide and open, it only took a man to cut one of the arteries for the entire structure to collapse in on itself. Such is why Sukarno prioritized the naval budget so many years ago, weather he would be fighting the Americans, the Japanese, or even his own people, it had been clear for the longest time that the battle on the high seas would decide the fate of the nation.\n\nAs such, if Sukarno could utilize the navy to blockade the capitol of Hatta's state, total victory would be on the horizon."
 INS_Guide_The_Holdouts:0 "Guide The Holdouts"
 INS_Guide_The_Holdouts_desc:0 "While the original draft of Operation Phoenix X called for the quick encirculation of the capitol via the blockade, a major military maneuver, and a through stabilization plan, Hatta has proven himself more than resilient and more than willing to continue this fight to the last man. We are just as adaptable as the rouge revolutionary. Our encirclement and blockade strategy sends a much more powerful message than simply occupying a rebel town, by starving them out we can shift them away from Hatta and back into the loving arms of the President. After all, don't they remember the times where Sukarno kept the country safe? What has Hatta done for them but left their children dead and their village burned? Nothing. They will surely realize this and come crawling back faster than one can say Merdeka!"
 INS_Cut_Off_Aceh:0 "Cut Off Aceh"
 INS_Cut_Off_Aceh_desc:0 "The northern tip of Northern Sumatra is home to the Aceh people, a rebellious and fiercely independent group who, even in peace, continue to prove themselves a thorn in the side of the government. Whether it be from some ideological alignment or simple ending up fighting against a common enemy, the people of Aceh have thrown their weight behind Hatta and his already diverse coalition.\n\nGenerals Suharto and Nasution held opposing viewpoints on how best to handle the impending conflict but, in a rare moment of clarity between the two, spurred on by the dire situation of the country, met in the middle with their solution to the Aceh problem: simply leave them alone. The Aceh have been put down before and will most certainly be put down again but the bigger threat is dealing with Hatta and the Indonesian army is not prepared well enough to combat an partisan packed province whilst a civil war rages on."

 INS_Prepare_The_Marines_desc:0 "As part of General Suharto's plan to bring a swift end to the rebellion orchestrated by the Vice President, Suharto has called for the creation of an elite group of highly trained fighters, handpicked by the General from his team who were so vital in fracturing the PKI years ago. The team's orders are simple.\n\n1. Eliminate outer defenses.\n\n2.Lead the army into the city proper.\n\n3.Find Hatta and bring him to his knees.\n\nFailure means death."

The city has not only hosted spoken of his most lavish parties, but also harbors the memories he cherishes most, those of spending time with his wives, his children. The city was a second home to the president, somewhere he could always turn back to when the times got hard. Well, times are hard now, and Palembang is just out of reach.\n\nThe brass says the city carries much strategic importance but Sukarno would personally lead the charge to the city if it meant dying in its warm embrace. Palembang must be captured. Palembang will be captured. This the army and Sukarno can agree on, it was only a matter of time before he'd be on its sandy beaches once more."

 INS_The_Men_In_Medan_desc:0 "It's hard to get a boardroom of suits to agree on something as simple as a budget proposal these days, getting a city of millions to agree would be impossible. Although largely composed of the more liberal minded people of Indonesia, Medan is not completely committed to Hatta's cause. Some simply keep their heads down to avoid the horrors of war coming to their homes, even if they'd prefer not to live under what Hatta calls a "democratic republic".\n\nGeneral Suharto has connections, to some, it's as if the man sees and knows all. While it may occasionally give Sukarno the jitters, it also can prove extremely helpful in getting the people of Medan to stand up for what they believe in, to stand up for Sukarno! Having people inside the city will make occupying it infinitely easier."

 INS_Thus_Always_To_Traitors_desc:0 "Hatta was his friend. A man Sukarno felt he could entrust even the most secret information to. Hatta was a traitor. Sukarno knew it well. He had seen his men strung up by their feet by Hatta's generals, their eyes and tongues missing, their skulls broken and bleeding, if they were lucky enough to keep their heads attached to their bodies at all. If Hatta endorses their actions or not, it does not matter. What matters is that Hatta took this beautiful, peaceful, nation and turned it into a bloodbath.

Television, radio, and public meetings all give the people hope, but not only that, it provides them with reassurance, that everything will be alright in the end, that there is a competent administration in place to ensure the return to stability.\n\nThe battle for Indonesia is not just a battle of who can shoot the fast, drop the most bombs, or shell the most islands, but it is a battle between personalities, between which bombastic and firebrand leader can out speak the other. Sukarno is a natural speaker and Hatta cannot compare."

The civilian government is not properly equipped to deal with the outbreak of war, even if some generals occupy the seats in government. A completely war centered cabinet will be best equipped to tackle the issue of Hatta's rebellion. Suits do not know war, economists cannot manipulate the markets into winning a battle, and foreign ministers cannot negotiate with Hatta into submission. The people demand action! It is time for the government to deliver! Sukarno has lived his whole life in battle and he is properly equipped with not only the experience but also the resolve to bring Hatta to justice and return to the way things were. Merdeka!"

 INS_Suspend_The_Assembly_desc:0 "Sukarno has seen war through and through, who brought down the centuries old Dutch East Indies? Who stabilized the archipelago? Who has taken down the PKI menace? Sukarno has seen war. What all this has taught him is how to win and what makes you lose. The key to success in battle is not to wait for pencil-pushers to complete the proper paperwork to approve a maneuver. The Assembly is not fit to serve Indonesia through this crisis, it simply wasn't made to deal with the situation before us now. The Assembly, even if it is nothing more than a puppet show for the people to be entertained with, is still packed with some opposition, just to make the performance life like. It's too much a risk to let the Assembly operate as it is, we aren't even close to being in a situation where the slightest mistake is admissible, it's now or never.

They think that causing chaos and spreading terror will bring us to our knees but look at where you are today!

Generals Nasution and Suharto have made impressive work of Hatta's army but yet the war rages on. What most tend to forget is that Sukarno is no stranger to drafting and executing military operations.\n\nEven if old age has taken away much of Sukarno's ability to lead his people into battle, his mental shape is sharper than ever. The last few weeks, Sukarno has rarely left his room, only exiting to speak to his wife and to the people. Few have seen inside his room, but what few reports trickle out from hospitality staff and passing generals paints the room of a manic freak, with maps and diagrams plastered on the walls and floors. Known only as "The Hundred Days Campaign", the plan promises to end the civil war within one hundred days. While this promises to breathe new life into a demoralized fighting force, it's also a tall order. Should Sukarno not meet his goal, there may be consequences..."

 INS_Surabaya_Defiant_desc:0 "Simply due to its size, there are more cities, towns, and villages in Indonesia than even the government could cover within the census. During his deliberations, Sukarno weighed his options as he considered his situation. What cities pledged loyalty to Hatta? Which to Sukarno himself? There were even some who claimed neutrality in the on-going conflict. Every attack undertaken, every broken defense, every operation stalled; it was another man dead, another man radicalized, it was another kilometer that the Indonesia Sukarno loved drifted away from him. Regardless, Sukarno did not devote his life to leadership just to quit when the going got tough, no, now more than ever it was time to set emotions aside.\n\nSurabaya will not stay in the hands of Hatta. No matter what."

 INS_Ease_Rationing_desc:0 "As much as Sukarno is a brilliant strategist when it comes to the battlefield, the last twenty years have given Sukarno more than enough experience in public relations to know that besieged cities would be quick to defect once the food shipments stopped arriving. It's difficult to estimate the stability of the supply situation, but Sukarno knows one thing plain and simple; a powerful mandate from the people was more resilient than any armor, more destructive than any artillery piece, and more critical than the air he breathed.\n\n"Even if it'll complicate the food situation," Sukarno commanded, "nothing is more complicated than dealing with a starving Indonesian."

From Sukarno's bravery against the western imperialists to his budget somehow always fitting the island in the budget, the proud people of Sulawesi know one thing to be true, Sukarno is there to help.\n\nEven so, dissenters and rabble-rousers will always make themselves known at the least opportune time.

What Sukarno did not account for in his naivety, was that the blow would not come from outside his government, but from inside, by his own friend no less.\n\nNow, the decentralized army and governance structures are not only ineffective but a threat to the security of the nation.

Sukarno knows the path Indonesia must follow to not only succeed but flourish in the modern world. Hatta's tactics of coalition building only weakens himself and leaves the door wide open to infighting and squabbling between parties.

Sukarno has declared Bandung a frontline city, one that must be defended, no matter the cost. If Bandung were to capitulate to the rebel forces, it would be a slippery slope from there. Jakarta would surely be next, and from there, Sumatra in its entirety would be cut off from Sukarno's forces. No matter who must die, what tactics must be used, Bandung will not share the fate of so many other cities. If the Tentara Nasional can keep the city out of Hatta's hands, all the while forcing him to commit more and more resources to the struggle, it will enable an easy transition from a defensive line to an offensive one!

There are no do-overs, a general cannot slap his forehead and say "I wish I had performed the assault!" and suddenly all is right in the world. No, the assault must be made, the garrison reinforced for Indonesia itself depends on it.\n\nThey may grumble, they may moan, but in the end, this is their last chance to prove that they can be rehabilitated, that at heart, despite their crimes.

If Hatta is going to call in the big dogs, Sukarno finds no reason to not do the same. Establishing a hotline between Jakarta and Tokyo will make sure that Indonesia does not fight alone, but with her allies in Asia.

Yet, what are Indonesians if not a resilient people? One willing to fight to the bitter end for what they believe in?

The emotional strain is apparent on the President, but as far as the generals are concerned, conscription is a necessary sacrifice to balance out Hatta's American equipment and volunteers. It troubles the President, but at this point, what more is there to do?

While the plan was drafted in a joint effort between Sukarno, Suharto, and Nasution, who would be leading the operation was left initially vague. Securing the island means cutting the head of Hatta's rebellion right away and whoever accomplishes the daunting task will surely receive a large boost in prestige and find many promotions in their future.

In May 1946, he was appointed regional commander of the Siliwangi Division, which looked after the security of West Java. In this position, Nasution developed the theory of territorial warfare which would become the defence doctrine of the Indonesian Army in the future.

Suharto exhibits all the best quality of a soldier, loyalty, cunning, and an unwavering commitment to finish the task before him.

Native Borenoians who are still loyal to Sukarno, as few as they are, have already been made contact with and an invasion force will have men on the inside as well.\n\nAn operation such as this one requires the full support of the entire nation, thousands will be involved in the plan, ensuring the supply chain remains intact, and executing the mission itself.

Although the people had taken up arms against him, he had seen the hope he inspired in people, and it was enough to shrug off the doubt that swirled in his mind. Sukarno was famous for his speeches, he had an impeccable ability to rouse the apathetic to his cause, not with threats of violence or with ideology instilled from brainwashing, Sukarno was someone to talk to, he was Bung Karno after all.\n\nHe hadn't made a war speech in twenty years, he had grown accustomed to speeches for businessmen, speeches where he inspired laughter, not bloodlust, but at a time like this, could laughter be found anywhere? The capital had been put under lockdown and the Merdeka Palace converted to a military base. This was the threshold, the final test for the Indonesian people, and the results rested on their shoulders alone, the best Sukarno could do was to take a little weight off with a rousing message. His advisors had urged him to broadcast from the radio, but Sukarno wasn't a coward, he didn't fear the Dutch, he did not cower from the Japanese, he would not hide from his own people.\n\nSukarno grinned to his followers, "You have seen what we have built! How lucky you are to be Indonesian! How lucky you are to be prosperous! Do you know what the rioters are my friends? Jealous. Jealous that we have rejected their petty attempts to divide us into camps! Hatta would call you a liberal and you a fascist! Do you know what I see when I look out into this crowd?

Sukarno had been tested before, fighting against the Dutch, maneuvering against the Japanese businessmen, spending sleepless nights coordinating operations to maintain the fragile peace in the fledgling state. Sukarno had passed them all, standing tall atop a mountain of bodies, hands gripped on the wheel, ready to steer the country towards greatness. It was when he grew fat and content at the top of the food chain did Sukarno realize he had softened, letting subordinates get away with more and more. As he tore open yet another letter decrying his government, Sukarno swore to never soften again.\n\nHe had predicted from the start that factionalism would be the spear to pierce the heart of hawk-eagle, that once the soaring bird was brought down by a united front against Indonesian power, the vultures would circle and pick at its corpse. It made him sick to his stomach, to see everything he built go to waste at the whim of the power-hungry and the foolish. He gripped a letter tight in his clammy fist, imagine what could've been accomplished if he had been granted the powers he deserved! He certainly wouldn't have been in this situation to begin with. Where had it all gone wrong? That night in Palembang? Permitting some of the more wishy-washy governors to maintain their posts? No, the root of the problem had existed since the nation's inception, the politicians.\n\nSukarno retrieved a pen and paper, it was time for a letter of his own, this time he would not beg on his knees for the continued support of the military or for the Assembly to grant him the blank check needed, no, as the pen flowed on the paper, Sukarno resolved an issue he should've rectified decades ago.

While the simple goal is admirable, the situation demands a change of course.\n\nSukarno held much of the default support, he had devoted his entire life to the independence of Indonesia and the people recognized that. They had heard his speeches, seen his scars, some few even fought alongside him, but much could be said of Hatta as well. The two played a tug-of-war over the people, vying for control of enough of the masses to overwhelm their enemies. Hatta could not compare in the battle of oration, and yet, the number of recruits dwindled day by day. It seemed to Sukarno that perhaps it did not take words to vex one to fight, it took vision. The people today held sight in higher standing than hearing, what Hatta could not accomplish in a speech, he could compensate for by warping the perception of the standard of living\n\nIt was playing dirty, tricking the people into joining the cause of Hatta by speaking half-truths. Two could play at that game. Though Sukarno felt some resignation as he sat down to author his next decree, he put his mind at ease with visions of the future, when he could return to the prosperity and, more importantly, the normalcy of the early sixties."

General Suharto sat across from him, inspecting his fingernails.\n\n"I think we should do something about this." said Sukarno.\n\n"Hmm?" replied Suharto, looking up from his hand.\n\n"I think we should do something." Sukarno repeated. "I can make a statement today and have a law drafted and passed by the end of the week."\n\n"Oh." scoffed Suharto. "You're reading too many letters. It's not healthy." He gestured to the stack of unopened envelopes on Sukarno's desk. "Everyone has issues and you can't fix them all. Stop agonizing over every minor problem in the country so we can focus on more important things."\n\n"But it is important." countered Sukarno. "Some companies may bitch about it, but the cost will be minor. We could prevent a lot of ocular injuries."\n\nSuharto gave an exasperated sigh and shrugged. "Do whatever you want.

 indonesia.307.desc:0 "Sitting alone at a table in a busy square, President Sukarno finished his bowl of bakso. He swirled the broth around and considered the last, solitary meatball. The crashing waves of people flying through the square manifested a haze of rhythmic footsteps and conversation. Sukarno gulped down the remainder of his lunch and watched the rushing flow of citizenry.\n\nThe square's position in the city ensured a steady flow of foot traffic throughout the day. Stores, restaurants, and street vendors competed for the patronage of thousands of fleeting, immaterial customers every day. Not all patrons were spectral, however. Sukarno made a habit of visiting the same restaurant every week or so, and ordering a bowl of bakso. Nowhere else could he find a meal comparable in pleasurability.\n\nSukarno looked at the now empty bowl. It could, potentially, be his last. He had received an offer from a conglomeration of several wealthy Japanese businessmen. They proposed a simple transaction: Yen for a square. Through the complex alchemy of modern banking, loans, and flexible property rights, Sukarno could transmute a bowl of bakso into cash. A lot of cash.\n\nSukarno looked at the restaurant. The old building that carried with it an uncountable number of empty bowls and filled bellies. The Japanese didn't care about history, however. It would certainly be bulldozed to make way for a more modern establishment. Perhaps a few shops and an especially good bowl of bakso is a small price to pay for progress."

Furthermore..."\n\nOutside of the recording room, aides and advisors scrambled to and fro in an insectile panic.\n\n"Did you shut it off?!?" screamed one.\n\n"Yeah, but I'm not sure how much got out!" wailed another.\n\nAn hour later an irate President Sukarno sat besides a shaking Economic Minister Suwiryo.\n\n"You can't just do that, Mister President!"\n\n"And why not?"\n\n"Because the SKN is Indonesia, whether you like it or not. Piss them off and everything goes to shit." Suwiryo ran his hands down his face and sighed.

He examined the sprawled out files and documents, moving them around gently in an effort to avoid paper clip claws. Eventually he reached the beating, black heart of the animal. As a priest to a sacrificial lamb, he ripped it out. Black blood stained his desk, but, at last, he divined the truth.\n\nFrom between the lower right accounting book and the upper ventricle of a tax return, Sukarno excised conspiracy. Using a combination of tax loopholes and the self interest of public officials, a cabal of Japanese industrialists had used the state of Indonesia as a means of laundering money from illegal, yet tolerated, businesses across the Sphere. Drugs, human trafficking, and arms yielded great, yet dirty, quantities of money. It had to be washed somehow, and Indonesia was the place to do it.\n\nSukarno reached for the telephone. One quick call and the Japanese businessmen, and their sullied profits, would be gone. His hand paused. It was a lot of money to be sure. He looked at the vivisected paper creature. He wondered how much that information was worth to them. Indonesia could always use more money. After all, it didn't really matter where it came from as long as it ended up in the right place."

Nahdlatul Ulama leadership discussed political strategy and geopolitics in what was, for the most part, a monotonous drivel of agreement and deferment. No contradictions, challenges, or conflicts troubled the status quo. Sukarno enjoyed these meetings. He wished his own subordinates were as well behaved as the Islamists'.\n\n"With all due respect, secularism is not in conflict with Islam." rung out a solitary, strong voice.\n\nThe room, which had previously been awash with friendly chatter, fell into a sudden silence. Heads turned towards a young, flustered politician. Sweat ran across his forehead and his left foot rapidly tapped the ground, but his words were confident and assured.\n\n"Combining state and religion is a fool's errand. It perverts the union Islam has with the people and appropriates it to the state. All this serves to do is incite tension and conflict."\n\n"Learn your place." spat an older partocrat.\n\nSeveral other party members began criticizing the dissenter as he grew increasingly frustrated. Voices slowly rose and faces reddened.\n\nSukarno looked on in pure curiosity. He had never seen them get into such a virulent argument. He noticed several other, neutral party members nervously glancing towards him for guidance concerning the current debate. He sighed. It seemed he would have to involve himself after all."

President Sukarno was bored out of his wits.\n\nEventually, the Coalition finished their entirely superfluous discussion and passed the proposed budget to him. Idle chatter picked up as they awaited the final rubber stamp. Sukarno examined the proposal. It was nearly identical to the previous one. It was under ambitious, safe, and cautionary - everything he wasn't.\n\n"This budget leaves much to be desired." he stated absentmindedly.\n\nThe infant dialogues died in their cribs.\n\n"If we make several adjustments, we could see a greater potential for economic growth and government efficiency. It won't take much, just..." Sukarno quickly scribbled out several notes on the document with a nearby pen. "That should be about it."\n\nThe modified budget was passed around the room. The ensuing debate took on a sincerity that the previous lacked.\n\n"It's our humble opinion. Mister President, that your plans are simply too ambitious." said a senior representative. "It's a risk that we can't take. What are we to do if this plan fails?"\n\nMutters of agreement and the occasional dissent filled the air. Sukarno felt the room turn against him as he prepared his response."

President Sukarno, as enamored with the day's mild beauty as any other citizen, donned his sharpest shades and smartest suit.\n\nHe trawled Jakarta in search of a suitably populated intersection or public square. After only half an hour, he found himself speaking to a decently agitated crowd. The good weather granted his voice a particular verve so uncommon among other politicians. The people fit his words like a glove and cheered his every imperative. He smiled. It was an excellent day. Absolutely nothing could ruin it.\n\nThe government vehicle, black like an unwanted cloud, pulled over near the rally. A man in a suit as black as the car got out and moved through the crowd easily,his authority acting as a bow in a sea of people. He approached Sukarno and pulled him away from endless adoration with a few concise words.\n\n"Representative Ali's wife has gone to the press. We expect the story to break in an hour or so."\n\nSukarno felt his heart jump to his throat and then fall to his stomach. His perfect day was ruined by what would certainly be a mess of phone calls and public appearances. He glanced back at the excited mass of people eagerly awaiting him. Perhaps his day didn't need to be sullied after all."

A night of sex, drugs, music, and gambling awaited him. He shuddered in anticipation.\n\nA knock sounded from his office door. Sukarno grumbled and returned his feet to the ground.\n\n"Come in."\n\nA Nahdlatul Ulama representative quickly entered the room. His face beamed with excitement.\n\n"Mister President, I'm sure you've heard but that new bridge was completed earlier than expected. In fact, we've moved the opening ceremony to tonight. I thought it best to inform you of the reschedule personally given the short notice of-"\n\n"What?" Sukarno interjected. He glanced at the clock. Three minutes. "I thought the ceremony was tomorrow?"\n\n"Well, it was, Mister President, but it's been moved as I just explained." replied the representative with a pained smile.\n\n"No, you don't understand," Sukarno said, shaking his head. "I'm otherwise indisposed tonight."\n\n"Ah yes... the party. This opening is an important PR event. Your absence would give the press a lot of ammunition. I urge you to reconsider your plans for tonight."\n\nSukarno's eyes flicked towards the clock. Two Minutes. He could still make it out. The greatest party of his life was still in reach."

In fact, I'd offer his position to his wife if she wasn't, quite literally, in bed with the opposition."\n\nPresident Sukarno's words shocked the skeleton press crew at his latest public appearance. What was supposed to be a routine rally quickly escalated into a critical tangent against a prominent Coalition member. The cameras rolled, the microphones recorded, and by the end of the hour the government was in chaos.\n\n"Mister President, you need to make another appearance. You need to apologize for your comments."\n\nSukarno and his advisor were alone in his office. He had locked the door to keep out rabid politicians while he planned his next move.\n\n"What is there to apologize for?" Sukarno asked sharply. "Everything I said was true."\n\nThe advisor sputtered. "The Coalition is breaking, Mister President."\n\nSukarno waved a hand. "It's always breaking.

 indonesiapeace.1.desc:0 "Suharto stopped before the gargantuan mahogany doors to the bedroom of Sukarno. Two guards, armed, stood sentry at both sides. Suharto only need raise an eyebrow and the two were off. They had their payment. Suharto crept in, on the far left side of the room sat a tall white bed, a thick lump occupying its center. Suharto flicked on the lights. Immediately, the lump stirred to life. "The nerve, do you even know the time?" Questioned Sukarno.\n\nSuharto chuckled under his breath, "I know. It's ridiculous." Sukarno's face was frozen in a confused frown. Suddenly, Sukarno thrashed in his bed, throwing the covers off him and ripping open the drawer of the bedside table. Sukarno kept his eyes locked with Suharto's as he desperately floundered around, searching for an object that was there. Suharto's bored face slowly morphed into a grin. "It's not there Bung."\n\n"Guards! Help me!" Sukarno cried.\n\n"No ones coming Sukarno. I think what's sad about you is that you're no better than any men you've sent off to die, you fear, you want, you love. You talk a lot of talk, but when push comes to shove, you are nothing, rendered a misrable, feeble nothing." Suharto dropped into a sprint, charging towards Sukarno. His time in the military had trained him for this but he had been planning this for years, even long before the civil war began. He grabbed the old man by the neck and pressed down, vaulting himself up and on to the bed, crouching over top of him. He watched Sukarno squirm, he bled as he clawed at his skin, but Suharto felt nothing, he hadn't in a long while.\n\nLong after the revolutionary expelled his last breath, Suharto sat on top of him, squeezing as hard as he could. After hours, decades, centuries maybe of squeezing every last modicum of life out of the president, Suharto slowly climbed off him and straightened out his jacket. This was only the first phase, now it was onto the next. Suharto glanced at his watch as he closed the door behind him, leaving Sukarno in his palace. His agents were probably just making contact with Hatta. It was less than ideal to make a deal with Hatta but he didn't have much of a choice. There was no turning back now."

The last holdouts thundered in the soft rain, the remaining generals formulated hopeless counterattacks, and the final, desperate pleas for a negotiated settlement were made, but Indonesia was at peace.\n\nThe war, like a gruesome butcher's knife, divided the nation. Brother fought brother. Father killed son. Friend turned on friend. It was a battle of armies as much as personalities. No one knew this sad reality better than Hatta.\n\nHe had hoped to save Sukarno. He couldn't, and he wouldn't, pardon his crimes, but he could at least stay his execution. For all his faults, his terrible, bloody faults, he was still his friend. He was still the man who had built Indonesia. He had still done what he thought was right. He was still Bung.\n\nThe PKI militias, drunk on their violent mob justice, didn't give him that chance. They didn't see Bung. They saw a tyrant, reduced his identity to his crimes, and strung him up accordingly.\n\nSukarno was gone. Indonesia remained.\n\nAs Hatta prepared to greet the crowds, to meet with the radical leaders of parallel revolutions, and to build a new, different Indonesia, he couldn't help but imagine Sukarno standing beside him, advising him, joking with him, even arguing with him. As Hatta stepped, uncertain, into the future, Sukarno's phantom followed him like a shadow, coloring the whole of Indonesia a perfect grey for many years to come."

 indonesiapeace.3.desc:0 "President Sukarno, the rightful, or at least victorious, leader of Indonesia stared blankly across the waving, bouncing field of people. They were cheering. All of them. Sukarno didn't understand why.\n\nHe was relieved, certainly, but not happy. How could he be happy? He looked at the papers in his hands. A speech, written by General Suharto. The President had wanted to deliver his own impassioned monologue to the adoring masses but, for some reason, he did not have the resolve to refuse the general's request. Sukarno's forehead creased in confusion. Since when did he do what Suharto told him to?\n\nHe briefly glanced over at the man. Unlike the rest of Sukarno's entourage, he was smiling. He had a huge, positively ecstatic grin plastered over his fat face. He looked like a gambler who had put everything on black and walked away a millionaire. Sukarno tilted his head. Since when did Suharto smile?\n\nNext to him sat Defense Minister Nasution. A grim weight pulled his mouth downwards into a distasteful frown. Sukarno mirrored the frown. He had already seen the plans. The terrible, sharp diagrams and reports. The war was won, but resistance would certainly continue. Nasution's job was to end that resistance as quickly as possible by any means necessary. Unfortunately for the rebels, Nasution's definition of necessity was terrifyingly liberal.\n\nSukarno turned back to the screaming, proud storm of people. For a few dozen minutes he was President Sukarno, savior of Indonesia. The speech was grand. The tempo of inflammatory wit and adulation of the crowd moved back and forth in tandem. At the end, as he made his last, blazing promises, he almost forgot he was a player on a stage.\n\nWhen he finished and the last chants had died down, he took his seat as another, less important official gave his own performance. He turned to Hatta, his Vice President and friend, to ask him how he did. Was it good? What did you think? He knew he could always count on him for honest criticism and pertinent advice.\n\nBut Hatta wasn't there. Hatta was gone - had been gone - for a long time. The backdrop fell away. The spotlight moved on. The curtains closed around Sukarno. His role had reached its conclusion; The play was over."

The light grey sky blanketed the earth, as though comforting it with well meaning, yet inadequate, care. The drizzle tapped the roof in a soft rhythm.\n\nHatta turned away from the rain and focused on the document in front of him. It was an offer of peace from the rival Indonesian government. The proposal was simple enough: an immediate cessation of hostilities and the creation of a unity government with Hatta as President. The message was notable, not only for its content, but because it was signed with the authority of General Suharto and not President Sukarno.\n\nHatta had heard rumors. The whispers of spies and traitors quickly found their ways to his ear, but he had refused to believe them. Sukarno? Couped? Unlikely. Yet the proof lay on his desk and no choice remained but to confront it.\n\nHe would accept the offer, of course. He was tired. Tired of fighting. Tired of the endless tough calls and crisis. Most of all, he was tired of watching the nation he loved destroy itself a hundred times over. The Islamists would hate it, but they would fall in line. The communists would go kicking and screaming, but they would go nonetheless.\n\nHatta returned to the flying droplets of water. They fell through the air, their lives brief accelerations to the earth. The ground was certain, yet they struggled towards it all the same. The thunder rolled onwards, the raindrops journeyed from the heavens, and Hatta composed his response to Suharto, accepting his terms and deciding the fate of Indonesia."
